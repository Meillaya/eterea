Don't want to use compile?
- Allocate the output buffers yourself
- Directly call into optimized cuBLAS with `torch.addmm`, `https://t.co/aY0JgNoaZ9`, `torch.addcmul`, `torch._addmm_activation` and similar
- Fuse memory bound operations yourself with simple triton kernels
- Wrap in cudagraph if memory permits

Want to go faster than FA2 and FA3?
- clone Tri Dao's repo
- shape specialize and extensively tune for your specific shapes ~ easy 15-30 TFLOPS for H100
- (BTW I've heard at least one person who's gotten a ~70-90 TFLOPS better BF16 performance with some numerical loss, but they didn't mention how and so I'm trying to figure it out myself lol)

The benchmark below is with Wan 2.1 480P 5 seconds, but 2-4 H100s with context-parallel should do the trick for Wan 2.2 720P 5s because it has a better compression VAE (16x16x4)

- Alternate between 128-sliding window layers and dense layers. This is the same as GPT-3.

- top-k MoE, with no shared expert and k=4. Standard load balancing loss.

- Really nonstandard swiglu - Uses σ(αx) where α=1.702 which makes the silu approximate a gelu. Clips gate activations to (-inf, 7], and up activations to [-7 and 7]. Adds 1 to up activations so final output is (up + 1)*glu instead of up*glu, which probably helps with gradient flow.","2025-08-05T18:31:30.000Z","https://x.com/AdamZweiger/status/1952799642636148917"

Some good details about Muon:
1. Dion is using MuP + Muon (so it is correct to use @jxbz  's spectral norm control rather than Moonshot's Matching Update RMS), 
2. The readme claimed not to use nestrov, but the code by default uses nestrov. We should be using nestrov, I believe both Moonshot and Keller found that using nestrov is better
3. WQKV are separate, so it is practically better
4. The alltoall impl is good, avoiding the fsdpv2 dim-0 sharding as discussed in here: https://t.co/JB5HkQQzR6

Some parts I personally think can be even better:
1. MuP impl does not tune hyper-params of std and wd. It uses the spectral control init as described in https://t.co/4OtcQxVWu7 and https://t.co/KCIvPJvVcl , but that does not mean the std is set to \sqrt(1/d_in * min(1, d_out/d_in)). Instead another std and weight decay are still needed. The spectral norm control is designed for MuP transfer, but you still need to tune the hyper-params for a fair comparisons
2. the alltoall is not optimal, the momentum does not need to do the alltoall, instead, you could do local momentumn update first, then only run alltoall on the updated grad with momentum to save communication, like this PR:  https://t.co/gU1jhSGud4
3. A even better impl: you do not need the FSDPv2 reduce scatter for the last micro batch after bwd, instead you can hack the grad reduce scatter to be the alltoall in the optimizer step. as a result, you can further save one more communication. stay tuned, this is WIP: https://t.co/NSTpjd94Lu

NoLoCo (https://t.co/ajDblARM3D) from @gensynai proposes two contributions on top of DiLoCo:

1. Gossip: instead of waiting for a all-reduce between all DiLoCo replicas, make group of 2 at each outer step. 
* Communication is limited to that pair, so basically doing gossip. 
* 1st term is momentum, 2nd term new outer gradients reduced within the local group of size n
* 3rd term is a regularization forcing the outer params of the group to be close
* 3rd term imply sending twice more data (!): outer grads + params, but luckily those params are constant for a  H=50 inner steps and thus can be fully overlapped
* it reminds me a bit of MoshpitSGD (https://t.co/Z7MgqMofuP)

2. Dynamic pipeline (somewhat reminiscent of SWARM https://t.co/cHnXJqtHWs) 
* where at each inner step, the different stages of the pipeline are mixed. 
* Cute but not really the main point of this paper.

Overall, very cool to see DiLoCo working well in this gossip learning setting, congrats to the NoLoCo authors! That's the most interesting paper i've read on distributed recently

Idk how well the baselines were tuned, the token budget is ok for 1B but too small for 6B. But they match or slightly improve over DiLoCo. Some things I'd like to see:
* Does NoLoCo behave better as the number of replicas scale? From table 2 it seems ~ as DiLoCo
* What's the perf without the 3rd term of eq (2)?

But, credit when credit is due, this is a genuinely fascinating study.

It is in fact - somewhat ironically - the data-driven and unequivocal proof that Marx was correct when he said that capitalist wealth accumulation in Western imperialist countries was fundamentally based on exploitation and unequal power relations rather than fair market exchange.

Let's look through the paper.

First of all, a key value of the work is that Piketty and Gastón Nievas (a PhD student) base their study on a new database that they put together (which you can access here: https://t.co/rCYWhDT6u6) that systematically reconstructs global trade flows and balance of payments for the entire world over more than two centuries (1800-2025).

This is genuinely groundbreaking work. No one - to my knowledge - has ever before created such a comprehensive database that tracks not just the ""visible flows"" of goods trade, but crucially the ""invisible flows"" of services, foreign income, and foreign transfers across the entire world - covering 48 major countries individually plus 9 residual regions that together achieve complete global coverage of population and GDP over more than 2 centuries.

What makes this database particularly valuable is that it allows us, for the first time, to see the complete picture of how wealth actually flowed between regions since 1800.

And not just what was officially traded, but the colonial transfers, tribute payments, ""home charges"" from India to Britain, debt impositions on Haiti and China, and all the other mechanisms through which the West extracted wealth from the Global South.

What the data shows is what everyone in the Global South knew instinctively but was contradicted by the dominant economic narrative: the West's wealth was built not through superior productivity or ""free trade,"" but through systematic extraction, forced transfers, and colonial plunder on a scale that dwarfs anything previously quantified.

Take this extraordinary metric for instance: the authors' simulations show that a mere 20% increase in primary commodity prices over the 1800-1914 period, which the study says ""corresponds to an absolute lower bound estimate of the value of unpaid forced labor in the export production of cotton, sugar, grain, etc. over this period,"" would have left Europe with foreign debts equivalent to 160% of its GDP, completely reversing global wealth patterns.

Put another way: had Western imperialist powers actually paid for what they took instead of extracting it through colonial violence and unpaid forced labor, the ""developed"" world would have been the ""developing"" world, and vice versa.

What’s also extraordinary is that this system of extraction very much continues to this day.

In fact, it is natural to use Muon as the optimizer for MuP-based model training from the derivation. 

I would think this is more exciting than Moonshot's Moonlight work of transferring from AdamW's HP to Muon via matching update RMS. While it is an empirically good heuristic, it does not take advantage of Muon's nature of 'controlled' spectral Norm for its update (updates from the msign/NS func), which is also an important property for muP to work by controlling the update spectral Norm to O(1)! 

I would be surprised if, by the end of the year, no tech companies scale the MuP + Muon. Basically, Jeremry already derived everything you need for a transformer...(Meta has MetaP, Moonshot is already using Muon, Greg is in XAI, and OpenAI hired Keller)

we'll be teaching the class on @MavenHQ starting june 16. as far as we know, this is the first course of its kind anywhere to bridge RL + LLM agents, and we’re really excited to share some of our favorite tips and tricks with you all.

both kyle and i maintain toolkits -- ART and verifiers -- for working with agents + RL, and the course will include coverage of both in different capacities, along with other popular agent tools (MCP, smolagents, etc). the goal is that you come away from the course feeling fully equipped to train your own custom agent models with RL.

the tagline pricing for the course is targeted at industry professionals. part of this is about managing bandwidth for facetime—the course will be highly interactive, and we want to ensure we can accommodate everyone’s questions. however, we also want this to be very broadly accessible to anyone who stands to gain from a deep dive into the material. while we want everyone in the course to have at least some ""skin in the game"" to incentivize active participation + attendance, we are more than happy to give very steep discounts, particularly to current students / self-funded founders / independent researchers. email me at will@[…] with subject line “Agentic RL Course” and some info about your background and i’ll get you a code.

as a preview, i’m teaching a free lightning lesson this thursday, may 29 (3PM PT) about building your own ""deep research""-style search agent. we’ll be doing a couple of these in the lead-up to the course if you’re on the fence, or just want a smaller dose of content. the course will be a useful structure for creating educational materials (notes, notebooks, etc.) that can be shared more broadly, for free -- maven's approach towards letting instructors own their materials while also offering really great course-hosting infrastructure was a key part of why we decided to work with them. more info below!

see you in class 🤓","2025-05-27T15:43:03.000Z","https://x.com/willccbb/status/1927390100977057834"

1) If you can avoid having a Distributed system. Do it.

2) If you want to scale quickly, reduce the state and make your nodes as stateless as possible.

3) If you want to control reads and writes separately, isolate nodes handling reads and writes. Bonus: you can also choose appropriate hardware for each. 

4) Choose consistency over availability whenever you can.

5) If you want to reduce congestion, reduce contenders. Single writer pattern, Lock free data structures, Immutable operations etc can help. 

6) If you want to make reads fast, make sure you can use “fast lanes” to fetch the data. i.e partitioning, indexing, caching create these fast lanes. 

7) If you want to make writes fast, use append only mechanisms and do all organisational tasks asynchronously.

8) If you want to truly isolate between tenants, use microVMs to ensure strong isolation with minimal overhead.

9) If you want to design a Cloud native system, build on top of cloud native systems, such as Object storage, k8s etc and don’t reinvent the wheel.

10) If you want to reduce complexity use first principles thinking and only solve problems that exist.

Bonus: Test as much as you can afford and use advanced techniques to uncover known unknowns and unknown unknowns as quickly as possible. 

Bonus++: Use formal verification to start thinking about complex systems in a simpler manner and uncover issues before they come to life.

This paper, from Mila – Quebec AI Institute and ServiceNow Research, tackles a key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of LLMs: how to choose which problems to train on, and in what order, for best learning and generalization.

🚀 The Solution: Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC)

A fully automatic, online curriculum learning strategy that evolves during training, designed to maximize learning efficiency.

🧩 How it works:

- Treats problem categories (by difficulty, type, etc.) as arms in a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB).
- Uses absolute advantage from policy gradient RL as a proxy for how much the model learns from each sample.
- Continuously updates the curriculum policy via TD(0) to favor problem types yielding the most learning gain.","2025-05-22T06:10:37.000Z","https://x.com/jiqizhixin/status/1925434103106797879"

my intuition is that we have three simple states for a ball in a soccer game: it can be in the center circle, in penalty area, or in goal 

and from each state you can perform some legal actions: kick ball to the left, kick right, or score goal etc

each action _could_ lead you to the next state, but not always. you can score a goal from the penalty area but chances are, you miss and remain in the same state. that’s the intuition behind transition probabilities

and then if you make it to the goal you get a reward

Addressing the challenge of liver fibrosis, a condition affecting millions globally with few treatments options, we've been working with Dr. Gary Peltz @StanfordMed, exploring how co-scientist can help with identifying new therapeutic avenues for this complex disease.

Specifically, we tasked co-scientist with proposing novel hypotheses for epigenetic alterations leading to myofibroblast formation in liver fibrosis, suggesting new treatments and designing experimental protocols for validation. 

Towards this, the co-scientist uncovered and highlighted histone deacetylation and DNA methylation, pointing towards HDAC (like Vorinostat), DNMT and BRD4 inhibitors as treatment options for study in advanced human liver organoid systems.

Experimental validation by Dr Peltz's lab @StanfordMed showed HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat & BRD4 inhibitors had significant anti-fibrotic effects in the organoid models; further Vorinostat also aided regeneration and cut TGFβ-induced chromatin damage by 91%.

We had previewed this work back in Feb but super glad to see comprehensive experimental validation results backing up the co-scientist generated hypotheses.

Notably, this work was done with an older version of the system from last year. 

We have made considerable progress building on the latest Gemini 2.5 models. More soon!

I want to highlight the theoreticians behind the scene, because this paper represents the realization of the impact of years of careful theoretical research.

It starts with Greg Yang (@TheGregYang) opening up research on the muP scaling and hyperparameter transfer in infinite-width models. Simultaneously infinite-depth scaling are studied by Boris Hanin (@BorisHanin), Mihai Nica (@MihaiCNica), Mufan Li (@mufan_li), and Soufiane Hayou (@hayou_soufiane), including in networks with residual connections. 

Then this builds further with the study of infinite-depth scalings and Transformers by Lorenzo Noci (@lorenzo_noci), Blake Bordelon (@blake__bordelon), Mufan, Chuning Li (@ChuningLi), Hamzat Chaudhuri (@hamzatchaudhry), Boris, and Cengiz (@CPehlevan) in at least 3-4 papers, in particular using the DMFT framework. 

My understanding is that the translation of these insights into this work was highly nontrivial and so congrats to Cerebras for seeing it through with this great team.

I also think this work could serve as a wake up to those in industry who reacted to muP saying ""yeah yeah yeah we ended up at effectively the same place through careful scrutiny"". I’d love to know which labs landed here, if any. If not, it goes to show you cannot have everyone grinding code. You need fundamental research to fuel BIG leaps.","2025-05-06T22:38:14.000Z","https://x.com/roydanroy/status/1919884437023817784"

The Chimera is a child LLM, using V3s shared experts augmented with a custom merge of R1s and V3s routed experts. It is not a finetune or distillation, but constructed from neural network parts of both parent MoE models.

A bit surprisingly, we did not detect defects of the hybrid child model. Instead, its reasoning and thinking processes appear to be more compact and orderly than the sometimes very long and wandering thoughts of the R1 parent model.

1.  intro: huge transformers need distributed training (model/activations > gpu mem). 
2.  bottleneck & fix: activation memory during backprop often limits scale. activation recomputation (checkpointing) saves memory, trades for compute.
3.  start simple: data parallelism (dp) replicates model, splits data. good first step, but memory-bound by largest replica.
4.  model > memory? use fsdp (zero-3). shards params/grads/opt_states across dp ranks. essential for fitting large models.
5.  layers/activations > memory? use tensor parallelism (tp). shards *within* layers. cuts activation mem, needs fast interconnect (e.g., nvlink). increases comms.
6.  combine: standard is 3d = fsdp (data/state) + pp (layers across nodes) + tp (layers within nodes). beyond this: seq parallel (sp) refines tp mem; context parallel (cp) handles long sequences; expert parallel (ep) manages moe models.

1. Unison

Haskell-like language where references work by hash, not by name (sort of like de Bruijn indices, but with hashes). Names are but separate metadata.

This is facilitated by the source code not being stored in text files, but in a structured format.

There are no merge conflicts, and you can pass closures to different machines in the cloud. Unison uses algebraic effects.

2. Effekt

A much, much simpler take on algebraic effects than the standard one, and an exercise that shows that sometimes less is more. In Effekt, functions are second class, which sounds alarming at first, but in actuality it behaves like a normal functional language. You don't have to give up much.

3. Flix

Another functional language with algebraic effects (this time with a more traditional take on effects). Flix has first-class Datalog constraints, which make it quite unique. Flix puts a lot of effort into tooling and developer experience.

4. Hylo (formerly Val)

An imperative, zero-cost abstraction language (like Rust, but much simpler) that's based on mutable values (as opposed to references). References in Hylo are second class. It uses coroutines for traversals, which make iterators possible even with second class references. Graydon Hoare likes this language.

Every morning it sends a brief to me and my wife via Telegram, including our calendar schedules for https://t.co/e5YyFZ3qxL","I've been hacking on a super simple AI assistant: built with a single SQLite table of memories and a handful of cron jobs, hosted on @ValDotTown.

The assistant is called Stevens. Every morning it sends a brief to me and my wife via Telegram, including our calendar schedules for the day, a preview of the weather forecast, any postal mail or packages we're expected to receive, and any reminders we've asked it to keep track of. All written up nice and formally, just like you'd expect from a proper butler!

Here's an example. (I'll use fake data throughout this post because our actual updates contain private information.)

Beyond the daily brief, we can communicate with Stevens on-demand—we can forward an email with some important info, or just leave a reminder or ask a question via Telegram chat.

That's Stevens. It's rudimentary, but already more useful to me than Siri!

Behind the scenes

Let's break down the simple architecture behind Stevens. The whole thing is hosted on @ValDotTown, a lovely platform that offers SQLite storage, HTTP request handling, scheduled cron jobs, and inbound/outbound email: a perfect set of capabilities for this project.

First, how does Stevens know what goes in the morning brief? The key is the butler's notebook, a log of everything that Stevens knows. There's an admin view where we can see the notebook contents—let's peek and see what's in there:

You can see some of the entries that fed into the morning brief above—for example, the parent-teacher conference has a log entry.

In addition to some arbitrary text, entries can have a *date* when they are expected to be relevant.  There are also entries with no date that serve as general background info—you can see these particular background memories came from a Telegram chat, because Stevens does an intake interview via Telegram when you first get started.

With this notebook in hand, sending the morning brief is easy: just run a cron job which makes a call to the Claude API to write the update, and then sends the text to a Telegram thread. As context for the model, we include any log entries dated for the coming week, as well as the undated background entries.

Under the hood, the ""notebook"" is just a single SQLite table with a few columns.

But wait: how did the various log entries get there in the first place? In the admin view, we can watch Stevens buzzing around entering things into the log from various sources:

This is really just some data importers populating the table:

- An hourly data pull from the Google Calendar API
- An hourly check of the local weather forecast using a weather API
- I forward USPS Informed Delivery emails containing scans of our postal mail, and Stevens OCRs them using Claude
- Inbound Telegram and email messages can also result in log entries
- Every week, some ""fun facts"" get added into the log, as a way of adding some color to future daily updates.

This system is easily extensible with new importers. An importer is just any process that adds/edits memories in the log. The memory contents can be any arbitrary text, since they'll just be fed back into an LLM later anyways.

Reflections

A few quick reflections on this project:

It's very useful for personal AI tools to have access to broader context from other information sources. Awareness of things like my calendar and the weather forecast turns a dumb chatbot into a useful assistant. ChatGPT recently added memory of past conversations, but there's lots of information not stored within that silo. I've written before (https://t.co/NfzmAgEIKV) about how the endgame for AI-driven personal software isn't more app silos, it's small tools operating on a shared pool of context about our lives.

""Memory"" can start simple. In this case, the use cases of the assistant are limited, and its information is inherently time-bounded, so it's fairly easy to query for the relevant context to give to the LLM. It also helps that some modern models have long context windows. As the available information grows in size, RAG and fancier approaches to memory (https://t.co/PZx6xZsekg) may be needed, but you can start simple.

Vibe coding enables sillier projects. Initially, Stevens spoke with a dry tone, like you might expect from a generic Apple or Google product. But it turned out it was just more *fun* to have the assistant speak like a formal butler. This was trivial to do, just a couple lines in a prompt. Similarly, I decided to make the admin dashboard views feel like a video game, because why not? I generated the image assets in ChatGPT, and vibe coded the whole UI in Cursor + Claude 3.7 Sonnet; it took a tiny bit of extra effort in exchange for a lot more fun.

Try it yourself

Stevens isn't a product you can run out of the box, it's just a personal project I made for myself.

But if you're curious, you can check out the code here (https://t.co/L9Cq8PnN0P).

If you want to explore, it's probably easier to just take this idea and run with it rather than using my code. You should be able to apply this basic pattern—a single memories table and an extensible constellation of cron jobs—to do lots of other useful things...","2025-04-13T16:07:46.000Z","https://x.com/geoffreylitt/status/1911451251524395494"

- Elegant example of leveraging hardware capabilities for maximum performance (AVX2, AES-NI, etc)

* UI tweaks
* Simplification
* Security upgrades

Lots of things I've wanted are there:
- DaisyUI
- Magic links
- Light/dark mode
- Scopes for resources
- Layout organization improvements
- Pub/Sub generated for resources (with LiveView)

After reading the latest announcement I created a few test apps to check out the changes...

## Scopes

*Scopes* are probably the biggest deal.

Resources should almost always be scoped to prevent IDOR and similar security issues. You need to scope at least to resource creator/owner and often you have an organization, group etc. that it belongs to.

So without scopes built-in, you're going to gradually create an ad-hoc version. I've done this a few times. It's just tedious and sometimes awkward.

Now when you run `mix.gen.auth` you create a Scope which applies to future resources you generate. 

Generators that used to give you list_items/0 or get_item!(id) will now create scoped function like:
- list_items(%Scope{} = scope)
-  get_item!(%Scope{} = scope, id)

## PubSub

PubSub is already nicely built into Phoenix, but now the LiveView generator will build the PubSub into the Context module directly and into the LiveView.

Say you have a ToDo app: every ToDo item that's CRUDed will broadcast the change, and LiveView is generated to subscribe on mount and react to changes.

It's all stuff that was never hard to write yourself, but it's good to have this built-in as a pattern.

## Security

Aside from the move to magic links, I also see improvements to the docs and code comments explaining security concerns.

## UX

There are a bunch of little things that aren't so little, like having light/dark mode just built in, and DaisyUI now officially ""part of"" Phoenix.

## Simplification

The way Layouts work makes more sense now, but I won't get into it -- it's explained pretty well in the blog post.

Similarly it's good there's been an effort to simplify CoreComponents although I didn't delve deeply into that yet.","2025-04-02T17:58:11.000Z","https://x.com/byronalley/status/1907492774498259065"

However, I don't find this result informative mainly because:

1. The original GPT2 arch is a weak baseline; and

2. It seems the hyperparameters weren't tuned

---

I've also noticed a couple more implementation details that make the baseline weaker:

3. The GPT2 baseline doesn't have learnable attention scales while the nGPT model does. This is a problem because not having learnable attn scales induces an upper-bound on the sharpness of the attn logits and thereby a lower-bound on the attn entropy. This constrains the model's ability to ""attend"" to important tokens during training.

4. The GPT2 baseline has weight decay while the nGPT model doesn't. And the weight decay for the baseline (λ = 0.1 w.d.) may be too high for the model size (0.5B). This induces an upper-bound of 1/λ = 10 on the singular values of the params and thus limits the expressiveness of the model. And

5. The GPT2 baseline uses the same learning rate as the nGPT model despite having activations of different ""sizes"". This may not actually be a problem in the end, but it's best to tune the LRs, other things, separately for each model.

---

And:

6. Given that nGPT is 10% to 17% slower than baseline, a perf-by-flops comparison would also be very helpful.

---

IMO it's best to:

A. Use a much stronger (SOTA) baseline like the one we have in the NanoGPT Speedrun https://t.co/TLiQiAjzoi and/or

B. Parametrize the models (both the baseline and nGPT) such that we can do hyperparameter search on a smaller scale first (let's say with 150M params & 10B tokens) then ""transfer"" the learning rates and other hyperparameters to the original, larger scale.

until then, nGPT will stay in the model arch purgatory

---

I actually see these kinds of issues a lot in published papers, sometimes even from bigger labs

Aside from misaligned incentives, I think another big problem is that we don't have an established & universally agreed process for comparing model arches. Every lab and every paper have their own process. It sucks.

It would be cool to have a Model Scaling Tool of some sort where a student from some random school can just implement their model arch idea, run the tool, then get small-scale results & hyperparameters for larger-scale versions of the model in case they want to scale it up.","2025-03-09T09:06:04.000Z","https://x.com/leloykun/status/1898661554184433929"

1. Bridging the gap","This paper proposes co-design and co-optimization across the entire stack for modern OLTP engines—from the top-level client and application, through transaction models and query execution, down to the operating systems.

Some interesting research directions:

1. Bridging the gap between applications and databases:  What is a better transaction model that balances security, performance, and ease-of-use? Interactive transactions remain the most common pattern but suffer from high communication overhead due to roundtrips, while existing stored procedures are difficult to use and security risks due to insufficient isolation.

2. Bridging the gap between databases and OSes: Modern databases often bottleneck on network communication. Interestingly, even for disk-based DBMSs, the network stack overhead remains a critical factor—accounting for 45% of CPU cycles in Postgres when data fits in memory. For faster in-memory databases, the network overhead is even more significant. This paper highlights the need to explore kernel bypass optimizations for both the server and client sides (the latter is often overlooked).

Looking forward to more research in these directions. I especially hope to see more databases prioritizing user experience while exploring better performance!","2025-03-09T20:00:40.000Z","https://x.com/qianl_cs/status/1898826288586207568"

This is a nice little package, which interestingly starts with order theory, in a chapter titled ''Counting to infinity'',  often neglected in logician texts or explained extremely formally, for example in Jech' Set theory. 

The second chapter introduce you to First Order Logic, in a style reminiscent of van Dalen's Logic and Structure, with a nice sub chapter on semantics and substitutions. It also contains a nice explanation of Godel's completeness theorem, a result which is essential to your understanding of modern logic. 

What I also enjoy about modern text on logic, like this one, is that they also take the time to introduce model theory, which is the case in chapter 3. Computer scientists will appreciate the inclusion of recursion theory, in a well written short chapter, and also a nice excursion into arithmetic models and limitation theorems.

You also get an interesting explanation of Godel's first and second incompleteness theorem, and although you might want a more specialized text if you really want to get into that subject deeply, it's still a pretty little condensed way to get around the idea.

The book ends on axiomatic set theory, which occupies quite a few pages of the book, with a few of the more advanced results explained, such as the generalized continuum hypothesis. 

This book is not focused on proofs, and when they are presented, they are made clear and not over formalized, which I find important for a beginner's text.

Early in computer science as a discipline, it was understood that we needed to be able to reason about code. People like Dijkstra and Hoare described how to do it. One of the results was Floyd-Hoare Logic, which supports preconditions and post conditions to follow state changes. More recently, this has evolved into concurrent separation logics like https://t.co/RDq0TKAQcu that use the @CoqLang proof assistant to treat code in imperative languages building concurrent and distributed systems.

Coq itself is based on the other major approach to reasoning about code: by dealing with functions in the usual mathematical sense, logically constrained by a type system, with the logic supplied via the Curry-Howard correspondence. The advantage here is there are type systems that are not Coq’s, but powerful enough, that you can do this reasoning in your head, unlike Floyd-Hoare Logic or any concurrent separation logic.

Modern advocates of systems programming languages don’t exhibit any understanding of this. They’re actively hostile to typed pure FP, which we can set aside for the moment. But they also don’t know anything about reasoning formally about imperative or concurrent code in the languages they prefer.

All they’ve got is “get gud” and a royal pain in the ass attitude.","2025-02-16T22:43:51.000Z","https://x.com/JustDeezGuy/status/1891257208622723192"

I've been testing different critic-free RL algos on multi-task environments, and one thing I've noticed is that GRPO seems to slightly underperform normalization-free variants. This tracks with the results in the LOOP paper.

Why? Most likely because GRPO's normalization term, in a sense, penalizes large magnitude rewards. But in multi-task envs, these rewards are highly informative!

E.g.:
- If your agent gets a very low (negative) reward, then it must be getting things consistently wrong--and this must be punished severely. And
- If it gets a very high reward, then it must be getting things consistently right--and this must be encouraged a lot more.

---

Why haven't Deepseek and the rest of the open-source community catch this yet?

Because it doesn't matter for the way we currently train our reasoning LLMs anyway. We only have one source of rewards: the verifier at the end of the generation step.

But this is going to be a problem when you try to train an agent that need to complete multiple (verifiable) tasks per run (e.g. a browser agent). Be careful!

Yes, the goal of introducing a baseline is to reduce the variance of the gradient estimator to stabilize training. But this is the kind of variance we don't want to get rid of!","2025-02-11T15:18:51.000Z","https://x.com/leloykun/status/1889333283693179351"

The flywheel is simply RL on many hard problems with verifiable outcomes. 

* Writing verifiers, searching for excellent rollouts, and refining them are all embarrassingly parallel. 
* There is more compute and software engineering talent outside of the labs than within them.
* @PrimeIntellect has already built and validated the data generation half of the flywheel. Their community of compute volunteers has produced and gifted 2M verified reasoning traces (2.5x what DeepSeek used for R1-Distilled) already.

This unlocks bushels of low hanging fruit. Nearly anyone can accelerate the open source flywheel by working out any of the following:

1. Reasoning data selection

To date: LIMO and simplescaling 1.1 both find that ~1k carefully selected reasoning traces from R1 are sufficient to distill reasoning capability into Qwen2.5-Instruct models.

Careful selection to date has meant filtering for hard problems by filtering out problems the instruct model can already solve, and sampling for diversity. But there is more to do:

A. Ensure the reasoning traces are in-distribution wrt the student by filtering samples for low loss. Just about every post-training paper of note published in the last year finds that in-distribution data is a big deal, including https://t.co/fRLME7sSAh and https://t.co/QGVu5Z2DFB, this is almost certainly going to work. But it needs to be validated, thresholds need to be determined, and if there is a curriculum learning play (like easier samples first), of course that would be good to know.

B. Filtering may be done at token scale: with human data, if one masks high-loss tokens to spare the model OOD tokens (cf. https://t.co/n9WoGcQjlZ), ~3/4 of the performance hit from human data goes away. This simple hack might well work for synthetic data, too. But the threshold will be important to find.

C. Prompts may be filtered for quality by looking at the variance in output reward, cf https://t.co/hdl9HXsvU8. It's unclear if this applies to traces with verified outcomes, but it probably at least applies to the rest of the post-training mix.

2. Distillation data refinement

A. Pruning

Reasoning traces are often long and sloppy, which is slow, expensive, and gratingly neurotic for the user at inference time. At least one paper (https://t.co/Anz5VOkAY8) shows efficiency and accuracy benefits to pruning reasoning traces.

The targets here ought to be length (shorter is faster/cheaper), loss on the target model to distill (lower loss samples limit harm to base model's distribution), and accuracy (the final answer must remain correct).

B. Establish pruning limits / pivot token data mixing laws.

One risk of pruning reasoning traces is the loss of pivot tokens. Student models presumably need to see some of these!

So, the optimal pruning vs. pivot token mix needs to be determined. Determining where it is most beneficial to leave them (perhaps more difficult prompts) will also be high value.

B. Re-writing reasoning traces for low loss

Distillation reasoning traces are by definition off-policy for the student. As such, they are liable to be out of distribution, which is Bad.

We can fix this by re-writing high loss portions of reasoning traces with a FIM model, then verifying semantic equivalence and lower loss on the target model.

It may even be possible to do this very cheaply with @jeremyphoward's ModernBert: use masked language modeling (like this: https://t.co/lIqRlRcNb7) to swap out tough tokens, and use distance of the embeddings for the original vs. modified sentences to estimate semantic equivalence.

C. Reasoning condensation

<thinking> tokens are neat, but sometimes they're overkill, and many (e.g., Dario) do not find them aesthetically pleasing.

If and when is it constructive to integrate them into the answer with a more normal CoT (like Claude)?

This seems particularly promising in cases where (say) an instruct version of a student model can answer the question correctly (so you would filter the question out if tuning from that instruct model), but you are starting fresh with the base model and want more verifiably correct instruct data in your SFT or midtraining mix.

D. Persona reasoning

Right now, R1 and its distillates think in slop. It will be much nicer for many purposes if reasoning models <think> in character. e.g., if my System Prompt says the model is Captain Ahab, ""OK, the User wants me to pretend to be Captain Ahab, I should care about this whale,"" is lame, ""I'll follow him around the Horn, and around the Norway maelstrom, and around perdition's flames before I give him up"" is much more interesting -> likely to yield better results any time vibe is important (like creative writing) or the persona's particular reasoning patters are at issue.

3. Determine prerequisites for reasoning distillation:

Qwen2.5-Instruct models, which were mid-trained on lots of synthetic data, require less than 1,000 examples to learn long chain of thought (cf LIMO & simplescaling).

True base models require more than 1,000 examples, but no more than 800k examples (used in R1-Distilled). Dialing in filtered and SFT and midtraining datasets is going to be a big deal.

Now that the gains for post-training small to medium sized models are huge again, it's an ideal time to dial this in. Tulu 3 is the data mix to beat with clearer prompts (https://t.co/hdl9HXsvU8), unencumbered data, and in-distribution rollouts of exemplary quality (cf https://t.co/NtNn7b0Cra, https://t.co/tKeQDVCTtU, and https://t.co/quoBd7paeK for ideas)

4. Demystify the unreasonable effectiveness of DoRA.

.@winglian found that DoRA speeds up finetuning for reasoning by *a lot*. LoRA too --but not as much. Nobody knows why, but there's a quick and easy hypothesis to test: maybe FT is slower than LoRA is slower than DoRA because fewer weights are modified. 

If so, we would expect @DiLuo28's QuanTA (high-rank extremely sparse PeFT method) to be even better. This is extremely quick to test.

5. Build simple test-time compute levers.

The simplescaling folks (@Muennighoff et al) validated and wrote up something @_xjdr, @voooooogel, and others tweeted:

One can simply insert pivot tokens and forbid end-of-thinking tokens to force the model to reason longer.

The obvious next step for scaling TTC economically is branching on pivot tokens. i.e., if the model wants to 'wait', spawn a branch where that is replaced by an end-of-thinking token (or vice versa).

The other obvious thing is running multiple streams in parallel (which is reportedly what O1-Pro is doing).

From there, you need some means of selecting or aggregating one's responses. Majority voting, fuzzy majority voting via clustering embeddings, shortest-of-n, and selection via reward model have all been shown to work in some settings. They ought to be refined and compared.","2025-02-12T19:39:08.000Z","https://x.com/georgejrjrjr/status/1889761173349753048"

LoRA with GRPO also just work!

1. We removed double memory usage during vLLM serving and finetuning - Unsloth now uses unified VRAM space for both - so you get 2x faster, 70% less VRAM finetuning and 20x faster inference all in one package! Use fast_generate for vLLM generation.

2. If you don't have W&B logging, we now show all metrics inside of Colab as well!

3. Thanks to @shxf0072 for the first Unsloth notebook to GRPO Qwen 1.5B and Llama 1/3B on GRPO on a free 15GB Colab - it helped a lot :) Now 14B param model fits!!  Also shout out to @willccbb for the original GRPO starter Colab! And @jiayi_pirate for TinyZero as well!

4. LoRA / QLoRA also originally did not work for people when doing GRPO in the starter script - Unsloth will correctly load LoRAs in vLLM!

L2 distances have been a long-standing problem. They are frequently used in contrastive learning (Barlow Twins) but consistently underperformrf compared to the more popular InfoNCE.
However, @dbaek__ et al. propose a key change: weighting the distances to get probabilities.

Using this simple change, they get the more expressive L2 loss to converge well!
Instead of maximizing the angular distance between two vectors, we minimize the distance between two points in an N-dimensional hyperspace - love it.

Uses DS Prover as a base model to generate data in the resource scarce formal theorem proofs. The conjecturer is trained iteratively on previously generated conjectures that are barely provable by the current prover. The prover attempts to prove these with standard expert iteration. Using this method was able to prove 26.3% of the statements in the LeanWorkbook dataset.

I'm especially proud that I discovered several approaches that are not only powerful and simple but also translate well across all three languages. One example is type-level interfaces, which have the potential to revolutionize type-level design.

Additionally, I have two pledges:

1⃣If the book reaches 1,000 copies sold, I will write four more chapters and add two more languages to the Rosetta Stone section (in addition to Haskell, Rust, and Scala 3).

1. https://t.co/PNBlT79mSw","Hey folks 

I started getting deep into understanding how LLMs are built from the ground up ( I am always of the opinion that if you don't understand how something works from first principles, you will never be able to make the best out of it. ) 

Below are my resources 

1. Build a LLM from scratch book by @rasbt - this book is my starting point, and if you haven't already bought this book, I would suggest buying this. 

- I am documenting everything related to this book here ( Google docs) -> https://t.co/27mvWH6ROF

- I get too deep with respect to each concept. Not just at a higher level, but also like I get into the whys of things, the mathematics , and every single question that I get while learning about that particular piece of concept and its answer, I add these to the  doc , so it's very in-depth and you will have a much more deeper understanding along with the concepts from the book

- if I have to give you a simple example -  for  each stages of how to build a large language model, I always ask: - Why is this stage needed? - What is the objective of this particular stage? - What is the final model that comes out of this stage? - What is the mathematical formulation at each stage? - Finally, what are some examples?

- but by far the biggest unlock is adding more resources to this learning material , One is obviously the book but I I also recommend looking at the videos, particularly when you are learning the Introduction to Transformer Architecture,  The videos from @hkproj  is excellent.

2. 140 toks/s on 2xH100 80GB
3. Also found some tokenizer quirks!

Details:
1. DeepSeek R1's architecture uses 3 fully dense layers then 58 MoE layers. The MoE layers have shared experts as well, and Multi Latent Attention MLA replaces MHA. More detailed arch breakdown here: https://t.co/PdzLCoQClC

We leave the first 3 dense layers (0.5% of all weights), and all MLA weights (5% of weights) as 4 or 6bit, then quantize all MoE layers to 1.5bit (-1, 0, 1) with scaling.

2. Naively quantizing all layers breaks the model entirely, with infinite repetitions and gibberish. Also leaving the down_proj in higher precision is important as shown in our dynamic quants release - https://t.co/HkCMpDQPrG and the Super Weights paper: https://t.co/nr8uBBP4W9

3. DeepSeek by default adds a BOS. The <think> </think> tokens are individual tokens. Be careful of double BOS tokens during inference! The pad token should also be set correctly or you will get infinite generations if you want to further finetune R1 (or all distilled versions).

4. We used a qualitative pass@3 Flappy Bird Game benchmark - the goal is to ask the model to create a Flappy Bird Game in Python with 10 conditions like the background has to be a random color, or there is a best score etc.

5. Made 4 versions: from 131GB to 212GB:

Excited to announce the release of DBOS TypeScript v2.0! With this release, you can effortlessly add durable execution to any TypeScript app, whether you're using Next.js, Express, or other popular frameworks.

Durable execution helps solve many common problems, like:
1⃣Orchestrating long-running or business-critical workflows;
2⃣Running reliable background jobs with no timeouts;
3⃣Running a fault-tolerant distributed task queue;
4⃣Orchestrating AI agents, or anything that connects to an unreliable or non-deterministic API.

What I love the most about DBOS is that it does this all in a lightweight library that's entirely backed by Postgres. All you need to do to use DBOS is npm install 
 and connect it to Postgres -- there are no other dependencies you need to manage, no separate workflow servers.

Try it out and let us know how DBOS is powering your apps! Link below...","2025-01-16T18:26:33.000Z","https://x.com/qianl_cs/status/1879958433140748423"

But how did it get there, and where is it going next?

I love this paper because it gives both a historical perspective on SQLite and an honest look at its advantages and shortcomings. SQLite originated 25 years ago as a small package of data management functions for Tcl, but rapidly evolved into a full-fledged transactional database. It became enormously popular for three big reasons:

- It’s embedded and self-contained. Uniquely among major databases, SQLite runs inside your application's process instead of on a separate server. It’s distributed as a single C file that compiles to less than 750 KiB. This lets SQLite run in resource-constrained environments where a conventional database would be unworkable.
- It’s cross-platform. A SQLite database is stored in a single file that can be freely copied across almost any machine, regardless of architecture. In embedded systems where custom architectures are everywhere, this is a huge advantage.
- It’s reliable. SQLite has a stunning 600 lines of test code for every line of SQLite code, covering all sorts of rare crashes and failure conditions. This is huge for mission-critical systems.

What’s interesting about SQLite is that while it was designed for transactional workloads, it’s increasingly used for analytical (OLAP) workloads just because it’s lightweight and easy to add to a data science library. Smart database researchers saw this trend and built an embedded analytics-focused database, DuckDB , which has also become very popular. A big chunk of the paper is devoted to a performance comparison of the two, and the differences are striking:

- On transactional workloads containing mostly small reads and writes, SQLite is 10-60x faster than DuckDB.
- On analytical workloads consisting of large scans, aggregations, and joins, DuckDB is 30-50x faster than SQLite.

This shows how important it is to pick the right system for your workload! Interestingly, the authors propose some optimizations for SQLite based on ideas from DuckDB, like using Bloom filters to speed up big joins. These make SQLite up to 4x faster on some analytical queries, though it’s still an order of magnitude behind DuckDB. Hopefully cross-pollination between databases continues to improve them all in the future!","2025-01-19T18:18:04.000Z","https://x.com/petereliaskraft/status/1881043465632690289"

almost like i just learned to cast an ancient spell that requires lots of mysterious steps and ingredients.  for a long time i was trying, and nothing happened.  but when it worked it felt like magic

i've learned a lot so wanted to share a bit 🧵

- i'm doing *conditional* diffusion, trying to produce outputs x that depend on some inputs y.  my biggest blocker was that the architectural biases matter here –  you can NOT put the conditioning directly into the input, or the model will just learn to map y to x instead of using y to denoise the noisy input x. (the loss will go down but sampling will not work)
- thus the diffusion world has a zoo of ""conditional"" architectures that can be a little challenging to adapt for your problem. but you have to use one or else things just won't work
- apparently, architecture still matters in vision (sad).   initialization, residuals, and extra normalization can make all the difference
- learning a small ""probe"" alongside your diffusion model is hugely valuable.  you can just cut the gradients to the probe so that it doesn't affect training.  this way you will know when you beat the baseline.  (i'm not sure if this is common practice but it was invaluable for me)
- you need to incorporate sampling into training every-so-often. otherwise you will never figure out why your model doesn't work
- the normalization is super important.  your input data needs to have ~mean 0 or std 1.  otherwise learning might not work,  or will be super slow
- in diffusion a lot of things can have the same shape but be different ""types"" in the sense that they're incompatible in some way.  easy to make these bugs and the code will still run.  and you often can find them by checking that the norms, stds, and means are approximately correct
- complex systems that you write from scratch will inevitably have tons of bugs.  you can start with trying to learn the identity function (in diffusion just set the noise to zeros).  if you can't do this something is broken.  in my case this helped me realize one of my losses had a sign flipped
- in my opinion the loss after 1000 steps or so is usually a reliable signal for debugging architectural changes
- diffusion people look down on DDPM as old and outdated but turns out it's still ""good enough for government work"" and worked fine for me eventually
- wouldn't recommend the diffusers library.  not sure it's really being developed anymore.  heard the openai impl is much better
- in general building systems from scratch is a slow and frustrating way to do research and i would recommend most people just start with a good codebase and tweaking it to fit your problem.  but if you build everything yourself you will learn a lot and feel a deep sense of satisfaction when it all starts working :)","2025-01-17T19:08:12.000Z","https://x.com/jxmnop/status/1880331306204373400"

Basically, Warp specialization in Triton takes advantage of the GPU’s hardware-level concurrency by splitting your kernel into multiple asynchronous tasks (“warp groups”). 

Each warp group runs in parallel—communicating efficiently via H100’s fast shared memory. 

You enable this magic by setting a couple of autotune flags, such as num_consumer_groups and num_buffers_warp_spec. Under the hood, Triton now **automatically** schedules these warp groups to run concurrently, squeezing more performance out of the GPU.

In the example above (a warp-specialized matrix multiplication), you see how they do standard Triton steps—loop over chunks of K, load A/B blocks, compute partial results, and then write them back. 

The key difference is the triton.Config specifying warp specialization parameters (like num_consumer_groups=2 and num_buffers_warp_spec=3). 

That’s it: Triton handles splitting and overlapping work so that each warp group can make better use of GPU resources.","2025-01-17T03:43:15.000Z","https://x.com/andrew_n_carr/status/1880098533350732203"

key aspects:

1. if you have two gradients that are conflicting (they have a negative inner product), simply summing them can result in an update vector that is conflicting with one of the two gradients. they avoid this phenomenon by using the information from the jacobian, and making sure that the update is always beneficial to all of the losses.

1. AceMath (https://t.co/AB0y6X21u8)
2. rStar-Math (https://t.co/5aLdzcYgqV)
3. PRIME (https://t.co/p4kSH2Ig31)
Here are some of my naive thoughts! It could be wrong.

All of these papers are showing possible ways to reach o1. The secret source is pretty much the same thing: 
**high-quality/difficult prompt with verifiable answer**

1. AceMath takes a simple approach (rejection-fine-tuning -> RFT) to scale up all the SFT dataset to massive size based on the verifiable answer matching. No RM is necessary, but you can still use outcome RM to help boost the performance.
2. rStarMath uses self-evolving SFT approach to gradually boost the data quality and process preference model (PPM) performance. rStarMath is still an RFT, where the samples are coming from MCTS guided with PPM. Still, it requires strong supervision from the verifiable reward in the end. rStarMath also scales up inference compute by utilizing the PPM at each step.
3. PRIME takes a very different angle! PRIME actually uses PPO to train the model, but the major contribution is on how to assign the outcome's reward to each intermediate steps. It also relies heavily on using the verifiable answer to obtain the ""correct"" on-policy model outputs. 

The results are quite interesting. It seems that all these approaches are reaching similar results. Eurus-2 might seem weaker due to its smaller training set size. These results are all somewhat on par with o1-mini already/ Given some leakage that o1-mini is ~20B, it basically says that on there is no gap with o1 at least on math problems now. However, o1-mini might win significantly in other broader reasoning tasks, like physics, puzzles, etc. 

These results might reveal that reaching o1 is more of a data or infra problem than an algorithm problem. As we find great ways to scale up the (good and difficult prompt, verifiable answer) pairs from different domains, the actual algorithm might not influence too much. Some algorithms are more data efficient than the others, but many of them will take us to o1 or even o3.","2025-01-12T04:28:23.000Z","https://x.com/WenhuChen/status/1878297953330196807"

Leveraging the associative property of the marginal flow (due to it being a linear system) to split  training into many independent sub-training jobs focused on producing  “flow experts” that each model a subset of the data. These have no data dependencies to each other, so they can be trained wherever compute is  available. At inference time, they ensemble through a lightweight learned router.

The authors trained a 24B text-to-image diffusion model on eight independent nodes (8 GPUs each) for around a week.

(Its embedding model is already here!)

On December 19th: 
A collaboration between Hugging Face, AnswerAI, and LightOn brought us ModernBERT.

ModernBERT is a new encoder model family that outperforms BERT in many aspects while maintaining full backward compatibility:
• Better: Outperforms on downstream tasks 
• Faster: 2-4x faster inference speeds
• Longer: 16x larger sequence length

On December 30th: 
Nomic AI brought us ModernBERT embed.

ModernBERT embed is a new embedding model built on ModernBERT-base, with all its advances:
• Better: Outperforms nomic-embed-text-v1 and nomic-embed-text-v1.5 on MTEB
• Faster: Immediate FA2 and unpacking support for  efficient inference
• Longer: Embeds longer passages (up to 8,192 tokens)

Both ModernBERT and ModernBERT embed are Apache 2.0 licensed (fully commercially permissible).

The recipe notebook by my colleague Mary shows you how to use ModernBERT embed with @weaviate_io for vector search.

It's quite straightforward. When you finetune a LLM (or PEFT), you are taking a fixed base and tuning it against a dataset. Pretraining already fixed our parameters in a pretty solid matrix; so all changes must operate around this as the basis.

Training can't perturbate the base model outside of a certain range without the model collapsing, so viable changes will follow allowable patterns. This is why the resulting models are homomorphic. These trainings create kernels that are commonly known as 'task vectors'.

As long as these models remain homomorphic, and you only attempt to merge parts of the parameter space that are in the same alignment, two kernels can be interpolated to adjust the parameter space to have relative changes that assume the properties of both.

The alignment issue - this is where sign agreement comes in. Since merging generally compares the delta weights, it is possible that kernels may train out of phase. One kernel may have been trained in a positive phase alignment with the base model, and the other developed a negative phase alignment. Since they are out of phase with each other, their kernels would interfere.

I don't know if that's as clear as I would like it to be, but it's late.","2025-01-08T06:35:52.000Z","https://x.com/mjbukow/status/1876880483230830690"

Right now, the most popular key-value store out there is Redis, which is an amazing piece of software that combines incredible performance with support for complex data structures. However, Redis isn’t durable or consistent at scale: it replicates data asynchronously, so distributed reads aren’t consistent and the loss of any node may lead to permanent data loss.

This paper describes how AWS built a new distributed key-value store, MemoryDB, on top of Redis to provide durability and consistency at scale. The big idea underlying MemoryDB is to decouple Redis’s execution engine from its durability layer. MemoryDB uses Redis as an in-memory execution and storage engine, but redirects its replication stream into an AWS transaction log service. This allows MemoryDB to be completely compatible with Redis while providing better guarantees.

Unfortunately, the paper is a bit light on details about how the transaction log service actually works. I’m interested in the next paper to learn more! But what they do describe is interesting–the key idea is that since the execution engine and durability layer are decoupled, they can be scaled separately, so a database could run with a small number of (expensive) execution nodes but still be durable thanks to a large number of (cheap) transaction log nodes.

Another big focus of MemoryDB is providing strong consistency in case of failover. The key idea here is to implement a leader election mechanism that ensures that in case a primary fails, only a single new primary is elected and that primary is fully caught-up. The algorithm used is simple and clever: the transaction log service provides a conditional append API, where successfully appending to the log requires providing the unique ID of the preceding log entry. To become a new leader, a node has to append a new entry saying they’re the leader–which is only possible if they have the unique ID of the last log entry and are thus fully caught-up.

What’s the main takeaway?  The most interesting thing about MemoryDB in my opinion is how it builds on top of Redis. It composes the interface and high-performance single-node execution engine of Redis with a brand-new persistence and replication layer, thus enhancing Redis’s guarantees at scale.","2025-01-05T16:25:22.000Z","https://x.com/petereliaskraft/status/1875941673571909954"

(I was rather intimidated by the original post as I wasn't keeping up with the LLM RL literature too much","Quick primer for non-wizards about the post-MCTS LLM reasoning future (I'm kinda PRIME-pilled rn):

How will LLMs learn to reason? No math in this post, ~simple words only!

(I was rather intimidated by the original post as I wasn't keeping up with the LLM RL literature too much and it's very technical. But in fact it isn't that complicated!)

1. We are RL tuning an LLM to produce good CoTs (chains of thought). (Good == leading step by step to correct answers to complex queries.)

2. Basic approach is to use ORM (Outcome Reward Model) - try answering a query by rolling out a CoT, and check if it led to the right answer. This gives a positive/negative reinforcement to each token in the CoT (each token in the particular CoT gets the same reward).

The problem is that each rollout gives you only final outcome info, no sense if any particular CoT step actually helped move towards the result. Convergence is slow, so is ood generalization etc.

3. So let's give a per-CoT-step reinforcement using a PRM (Process Reward Model). Like teaching humans, tell them if they go in the right direction, don't just look at the final result. The very first idea explored was to just use per step human supervision during the CoT RL, but that's obviously unsustainable.

4. Enter MCTS-inspired approaches for automated PRM supervision. Given a few next possible CoT steps, which one is more helpful, can we tell automatically? Well, try rolling out the rest of the CoT ten times for each candidate, and see which one reaches the right answer most frequently!

The problem now is that you need to roll out the CoT ten times for each candidate - a Monte Carlo approach. This is not efficient as you are wasting a lot of time on stupid CoT step candidates and lost causes.

5. Finally, PRIME (Implicit Rewards PRM). The basic question is: Instead of MCTS-like evaluating each CoT step by N rollouts, could we just run a beam search of N rollouts of CoT from start to end?

Well, how do we know how to reward each token then?  Why, by finetuning an *extra* copy of your LLM internally to use as per-token reward model. This extra LLM copy is finetuned using the Outcome RM approach (so sparse rewards just encouraging tokens that lead to good final outcomes). This LLM is then used as a Process RM assigning a reward to each token based on its continuously learned estimate of how much that token is helpful.

""Continuously"" learned? The reward model LLM and the main LLM epochs are interleaved - the estimates are learned in parallel with finetuning the main model, a sort of expectation-minimization dance.

Unlike just using ORM approach alone, this introduces an accretive effect - information on what works is shared across training batches through the reward LLM, and as it learns, it produces better guidance and the convergence of the main LLM speeds up.

PRIME of course also contains tons of important technical details. (Using PPO policy with alternative-normalized advantages rather than raw rewards. Keeping the initial finetuning LLM snapshot as a reference and considering only token logit changes to the reference, which makes the math work out. Formally proving it's better than MCTS. ...)

But this is the gist of the magic. And it results in reported 38x convergence speedup compared to MCTS.

Below is the list of papers that you should read and implement before proceeding to the ""Attention Is All You Need"" paper.

Start with Basic Neural Networks:
- Implement a simple feed-forward neural network from scratch
- Focus on backpropagation and gradient descent
- Paper: ""Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition"" (LeCun et al., 1998) - implement a simpler version

Sequence Models Basics:
- Build a basic RNN from scratch
- Implement LSTM cells
- Paper: ""Long Short-Term Memory"" (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) - start with a basic version

Word Embeddings:
- Implement Word2Vec
- Paper: ""Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space"" (Mikolov et al., 2013)
- Understanding embeddings is crucial for transformers

Basic Attention Mechanisms:
-  Implement Bahdanau attention
- Paper: ""Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate"" (Bahdanau et al., 2014)
- This is directly relevant to transformer attention

Sequence-to-Sequence Models:
- Build a basic seq2seq model with attention
- Paper: ""Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks"" (Sutskever et al., 2014)

Once you've implemented these, you'll have the foundation to understand:
- Attention mechanisms
- Positional encodings
- Multi-head attention
- Layer normalization
- Residual connections

These components all come together in the Transformer architecture.","2025-01-02T03:17:28.000Z","https://x.com/romitheguru/status/1874656226224570541"

these are bad:
- commit history is <5 commits or has an “Add files via upload” message
- fork of a popular project with hardly any changes
- obvious template project from a stupid webdev or other online course
- idea that was obviously built for the purpose of filling out a resume rather than solving a real problem
- no instructions on how to run it locally, best case is if it’s actually deployed somewhere
- no small writeup about the intention and future plans
- has 5 collaborators and everyone claims all the work on their resumes
- massive faux pas for whatever language you’re using. like committing node_modules or venv
- if you’re applying to an e.g. python role and your most recent python repos demonstrate unfamiliarity with language features, standard libraries, etc. it’s usually not a good sign
- abstraction slop like using langchain when it’s absolutely unnecessary

my green flag is if it’s an idea inspired by a real problem the person has, has clear shell scripts/bash commands for how to run it, is committed to over a period of a few months which tells me it’s a project they’re actually interested in, shows knowledge of modern libraries (like uv for envs), and has clear modular commits that demonstrate problem solving and design skills","2024-12-28T17:49:26.000Z","https://x.com/var_epsilon/status/1873063724606452174"

Announcing the Genesis project — after a 24-month large-scale research collaboration involving over 20 research labs — a generative physics engine able to generate 4D dynamical worlds powered by a physics simulation platform designed for general-purpose robotics and physical AI applications.

Genesis's physics engine is developed in pure Python, while being 10-80x faster than existing GPU-accelerated stacks like Isaac Gym and MJX. It delivers a simulation speed ~430,000 faster than in real-time, and takes only 26 seconds to train a robotic locomotion policy transferrable to the real world on a single RTX4090 (see tutorial: https://t.co/bEkIlCKqdf).

The Genesis physics engine and simulation platform is fully open source at https://t.co/DhBv7NdyqH. We'll gradually roll out access to our generative framework in the near future.

Genesis implements a unified simulation framework all from scratch, integrating a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art physics solvers, allowing simulation of the whole physical world in a virtual realm with the highest realism.

We aim to build a universal data engine that leverages an upper-level generative framework to autonomously create physical worlds, together with various modes of data, including environments, camera motions, robotic task proposals, reward functions, robot policies, character motions, fully interactive 3D scenes, open-world articulated assets, and more, aiming towards fully automated data generation for robotics, physical AI and other applications.

Transformer architecture works great but it's quite inefficient at inference time. Alternative architectures have been proposed to overcome Transformers limitations in particular for very long contexts.

Mamba is one of the recent inventions which uses State Space Models (SSMs), which speeds up inference thoughput and latency and excells at dealing with very long contexts.

If you're new to Mamba here is a good gentle explanation of how Mamba works and why it is a good replacement for Transformers

The test is conducted via the following https://t.co/ns7q49R38A","My favorite paper from NeurIPS’24 shows us that frontier LLMs don’t pay very close attention to their context windows…

Needle In A Haystack. The needle in a haystack test is the most common way to test LLMs with long context windows. The test is conducted via the following steps:

1. Place a fact / statement within a corpus of text.
2. Ask the LLM to generate the fact given the corpus as input.
3. Repeat this test while increasing the size of the corpus and placing the fact at different locations.

From this test, we see if an LLM “pays attention” to different regions of a long context window, but this test purely examines whether the LLM is able to recall information from its context.

Where does this fall short? Most tasks being solved by LLMs require more than information recall. The LLM may need to perform inference, manipulate knowledge, or reason in order to solve a task. With this in mind, we might wonder if we could generalize the needle in a haystack test to analyze more complex LLM capabilities under different context lengths.

BABILong generalizes the needle in a haystack test to perform long context reasoning. The LLM is tested based upon its ability to reason over facts that are distributed in very long text corpora. Reasoning tasks that are tested include fact chaining, induction, deduction, counting, list / set comprehension, and more. Such reasoning tasks are challenging, especially when necessary information is scattered in a large context window.

“Our evaluations show that popular LLMs effectively utilize only 10-20% of the context and their performance declines sharply with increased reasoning complexity.” - BABILong paper

Can LLMs reason over long context? We see in the BABILong paper that most frontier LLMs struggle to solve long context reasoning problems. Even top LLMs like GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 seem to consistently use only ~20% of their context window. In fact, most LLMS struggle to answer questions about facts in texts longer than 10,000 tokens!

What can we do about this? First, we should just be aware of this finding! Be wary of using super long contexts, as they might deteriorate the LLM’s ability to solve more complex problems that require reasoning. However, we see in the BABILong paper that these issues can be mitigated with a few different approaches:

- Using RAG is helpful. However, this approach only works up to a certain context length and has limitations (e.g., struggles to solve problems where the order of facts matters).
- Recurrent transformers can answer questions about facts from very long contexts.","2024-12-18T15:48:06.000Z","https://x.com/cwolferesearch/status/1869409312239415696"

A few hours ago they released ""Byte Latent Transformer"". A tokenizer free architecture that dynamically encodes Bytes into Patches and achieves better inference efficiency and robustness!

(I was just talking about how we need dynamic tokenization that is learned during training 🥲
It's like fucking christmas!)

I don't want to talk too much about the architecture.
But here's a nice visualization from their paper.

Let's look at benchmarks instead :)

""BLT models can match the performance of tokenization-based models like Llama 3 at  scales up to 8B and 4T bytes, and can trade minor losses in evaluation metrics for up to 50% reductions in  inference flops!""

This is basically a perplexity vs training flops chart - scaling laws with compute. BPB is a tokenizer independent version of perplexity.

BLT is on par or better than LLama 3 BPE!

Most importantly they scale this approach to train Llama-3 8B model on 1T tokens which beats the standard Llama-3 architecture with BPE tokenizer!","2024-12-13T14:14:04.000Z","https://x.com/scaling01/status/1867573707247346003"

https://t.co/cmfZw5LgiX 

Here are the highlights:

1. Anthropic’s Prompt Engineering Interactive Tutorial

The Google Sheets-based interactive exercises make it easy to experiment with different prompts and see immediately what works and what doesn’t. I’m surprised other model providers don’t have similar interactive guides: https://t.co/D0IP1eCMOI

2. OpenAI’s best practices for finetuning

While this guide focuses on GPT-3, many techniques are applicable to full finetuning in general. It explains how finetuning works, how to prepare training data, how to pick training hyperparameters, and common finetuning mistakes: https://t.co/JENqR2V17I

3.  Llama 3 paper

The section on post-training data is a gold mine as it details different techniques they used to generate 2.7 million examples for supervised finetuning. It also covers a crucial but less talked about topic: data verification, how to evaluate the quality of synthetic data: https://t.co/n0ysigxy9q

4. Efficiently Scaling Transformer Inference (Pope et al., 2022)

An amazing paper co-authored by Jeff Dean about inference optimization for transformers models. It covers not only different optimization techniques and their tradeoffs, but also provides a guideline for what to do if you want to optimize for different aspects, e.g. lowest possible latency, highest possible throughput, or longest context length: https://t.co/hyKsp1QY2A

5. Chameleon: Plug-and-Play Compositional Reasoning with Large Language Models (Lu et al., 2023)

My favorite study on LLM planners, how they use tools, and their failure modes. An interesting finding is that different LLMs have different tool preferences: https://t.co/cqRAlu9yOr

6. AI Incident Database

For those interested in seeing how AI can go wrong, this contains over 3000 reports of AI harms: https://t.co/zoHAb26SNX

7. I find case studies from teams that have successfully deployed AI applications extremely educational. Here are some of my favorite enterprise case studies. I'll add more case studies soon!

Core intuition:  there is a lot of useful work unnecessarily recomputed between documents that share a lot of context

BCR would be a way to avoid redundant computation when processing a large number of documents, for example when asking a lot of questions about the same book,  embedding a lot of articles... 

a system using BCR would work in three steps: 
1. group documents into contexts (""Contextual batching""!) – producing a batch of related things x_1, x_2, ..., x_n 
2. use a large model to generate some ""work"" for each context – z ~ p(z | d_1, ..., d_n)
3. use a small model compute outputs for each document conditioned on both that output and z – p(y | d_1, z; θ_s) 

if θ_B >> θ_S then this saves you about N compute where N is the number of related documents. probably in practice there would be a small performance decrease; have to tune N

Extremely simple change: instead of mapping between hidden states and language tokens using the LLM head and embedding layer, you directly feed the last hidden state (a continuous thought) as the input embedding for the next token.

    * take raw csv/json/etc  
    * infer schema  
    * create fast api endpoints  
    * zero config  
    * run locally or deploy easily  

---

but maybe something like this  

### 1. Crawl + Storage
```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Optional
import polars as pl
@dataclass
class JobPosting:
    id: str
    title: str
    company: Optional[str]
    location: str
    salary_min: Optional[float]
    salary_max: Optional[float]
    skills: List[str]
    description: str
    source: str  # 'usajobs'|'bls'|'onet'
    posted_date: str

def fetch_jobs():
    # crawl endpoints
    usajobs = fetch_usajobs()
    bls = fetch_bls()
    onet = fetch_onet()
    
    # normalize to common schema
    jobs = [JobPosting(**job) for job in usajobs + bls + onet]
    
    # save to parquet for efficient querying
    df = pl.DataFrame([vars(j) for j in jobs])
    df.write_parquet(""jobs.parquet"")
2. Query API
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query

app = FastAPI()
df = https://t.co/3tePztMxY5_parquet(""jobs.parquet"")

@app.get(""/jobs/search"")
async def search(
    q: str = Query(None),
    skills: List[str] = Query(None),
    min_salary: float = Query(None),
    location: str = Query(None)
):
    result = df
    if q:
        result = result.filter(
            pl.col(""title"").str.contains(q, ignore_case=True) |
            pl.col(""description"").str.contains(q, ignore_case=True)
        )
    if skills:
        result = result.filter(pl.col(""skills"").arr.contains(skills))
    if min_salary:
        result = result.filter(pl.col(""salary_min"") >= min_salary)
    if location:
        result = result.filter(pl.col(""location"").str.contains(location))
        
    return https://t.co/InvWE59cAk_dicts()
```

Key Points:

* parquet for efficient storage/querying
* normalized schema across sources
* flexible search api
* typed everything for reliability

The `int` instruction causes a soft interrupt to enter the kernel. It requires looking up the interrupt descriptor table and finding the interrupt handler for the given interrupt code. 

Reading of the interrupt descriptor table and looking up the address for the handler in it requires memory access. But syscalls are a very frequently done operation, to make it more efficient, x86-64 introduced a dedicated instruction which could avoid memory reads.

To do this the syscall instruction enforces a single point of entry for all syscalls, as a result no memory lookup is required . The syscall entry code figures out the syscall based on the value in the rax register and then calls its implementation.

This paper came out in 2003. Its core argument was that thread implementations in existing programming languages were shit and we could do better. They liked threads because of the linear programming model and their lower cognitive load. They implemented user-level cooperative threading which translates any blocking I/O to asynchronous requests internally (similar to Go?) and showed that threads can perform as well as events.

It's a companion to the 'Why Threads Are A Bad Idea (for most purposes)' (1995) paper. You need to understand both conflicting views for max 🍿","2024-12-03T13:08:41.000Z","https://x.com/iavins/status/1863933376627097644"

2. Adam-mini's loss curve closely resembles those of Adam. You can almost see no difference!

3. Adam-mini uses the same hyperparams as Adam (lr, beta1, beta2, eps, etc). No tuning is needed!

4. With the free memory you can enlarge batch size and achieve higher throughput (see paper). 

5. Principled design: The design of Adam-mini follows a very simple and general principle related to the Hessian structure of neural nets. Such design stems from classical optimization theory (see paper).

The Philosophy for Learning:
Many of you want to start learning ML whether it’s for a side project, getting into the field, or just gaining the skills to up your market value. Regardless of your motivation I’m guessing this is how you came to this article:

1- Got interested in ML somehow
2- Started looking into how to start
3- Saved a bunch of resources and guides
4- Haven’t done any of them

Often the hardest parts of learning are the end when you start to reach the really heavy shit, and the complete beginning where you are lost and overwhelmed which leads to procrastination. This is normal but sucks ass so I’m going to tell you how to get past it and actually make progress.

The best model for this is the 10,000 hours mantra Karpathy shills constantly. In short this means that if you put in 10,000 hours into anything you will become good at it, maybe not the best but greatly competent. With this model by putting in 10,000 hours it doesn’t matter where you start as long as it’s the elementary levels because throughout those 10,000 hours you will discover what you need to know that you don’t already, filling in knowledge gaps until you get to the cutting edge.

Now here’s how I’m going to motivate you with this, if you put in 1 hour a day it will take you approximately 30 years for this level of mastery. That’s a long fucking time, but consider this: moving to 3 hours a day brings you down to 10 years, and moving to 10 hours a day brings you to 3. This means that with every extra hour put in every day you are saving years until mastery which gives you more time to make an impact with your skills.

So in relation to ML you need to be putting in the effort and JUST START SOMETHING, literally anything. Put the hours into a resource, practice what you’ve learned with projects, then find knowledge gaps and fill them. Iterate through this process until mastery, but although motivating this still leaves room for confusion which can be used as another procrastination method. So I will take away this friction to your learning now with some places to start.

How to Actually Start:
Remember this article is written by me in a place to where I too am just starting my ML and CS journey, the main purpose is to KICKSTART you into your own studies. With that in mind here are someplaces to start with resources linked below. Most of this shit will be plagiarized from moots in tpot who have helped me with my own shit, so without further ado here is some starting places.

Do you know the math for ML (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Stats and Prob)?
Nuh uh:
- “Mathematics for Machine Learning” by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong
- Math Academy Grind (Do ML Roadmap there)
はい、パパ:
- “The Hundred Pages Machine Learning Book” by Andriy Burkov
- Andrew Ng’s coursera or youtube lectures

Do you just want to start doing project based shit?
はい、パパ:
- Start learning Pytorch via youtube or ZTM
- Start with random project idea and use LLM/Search Engine to learn things you need to know to build it

Are you reading this not even knowing how to code with Python?
はい、パパ:
- “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python” by Al Sweigart
- Leetcode
 
There, now pick something and do it.
Learn -> Apply -> See Knowledge Gaps and Iterate

it was the best thing i ever did. and no, there's no fun (or progress) in just reading it once and copying the source code. tweak it. make it your own. the code was just 1k lines of C in a single file, but i modularized it and learnt about #include guards, translation units (basically c source files), and Makefiles.

SO im starting a ""learn by building"" group, centered around building ML/math/programming/etc projects that challenge you, causing you to skill up in order to complete them

by doing this you'll grow your skills, and by doing it in a community you'll inspire/help others and get inspired by others. join if youre going to build a project, or if you already are building one

https://t.co/byDyJfDGB2

this has been how I've learned almost all of my programming/engineering skills, and it's EXTREMELY effective. ""I want to learn RL"" -> I build a small RL project -> I build a bigger one -> I am forced to learn tons of skills to complete each project and become decent at RL

How to do this:
1 pick a skill you want to learn/improve
2 build something that pushes you to grow that skillset
3 post updates when you make significant progress

in progress posts, it helps people/is fun when you put interactive demos, images/videos of your awesome progress, or write about what helped you (resources tips etc)

To have a larger spread of attention entropy and thus allowing the model to represent more certainty/uncertainty states during training!

---

First, why do we have to bother with the attention entropy in the first place? Because apparently, softmax disperses the attention coefficients through the context and through the layers! This makes them more uniform (especially at higher temperatures), thus increasing entropy.

This means that the larger your model is and the longer your context is, the bigger the chances of a ""wrong answer"" getting selected even if the ""right answer"" token has the highest probability of getting selected!

This paper [softmax is not enough](https://t.co/m0itIDe3it) explains this phenomenon much better & they propose some kind of 'adaptive temperature' on the softmax ops.

There's also an entropy-aware sampler, [Entropix](https://t.co/agnPBq6D8Z), that aims to counteract this effect at inference time.

---

But why don't we counteract this effect at train time?

Tbh, I don't know how to do this explicitly yet. But, we should at least pick an optimizer that doesn't collapse attention entropy to some small range of values

Vimal Kumar, the CEO of Juspay, who was also one of the first supporters of my Functional Design and Architecture book, told me that recently they developed several new successful services.

The EulerHS Haskell framework I and that I and my team designed for Juspay, is now used for one of the parts of NammaYatri, ""an Open Source equivalent of Uber"". The service is currently trending, as Vimal mentioned.

He also said that they developed an open source implementation of EulerHS in Rust. They then created a new product, HyperSwitch, an open-source payment platform, which has already gained 12K stars on GitHub already.

The EulerHS framework is the older brother of my educational Hydra framework developed specifically for the Functional Design and Architecture book. They are very similar in their ideas and architecture and share a certain ""fingerprint"" of my brain in them.

This is absolutely wonderful. I influenced a huge company (1300 people) at a time when it was small (around 30 people). My ideas and my book played a significant role in its success (not to forget other folks who actually wrote a lot of business logic which is 99% of the code). Vimal Kumar, a great Indian businessman, has been one of the first supporters of the book. He donated a lot, hired me and allowed me to implement my approaches.

With dynamic keywords, you can define a set of IP address ranges, fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), and autoresolution options, to which one or more Firewall rules can refer.""

caveat; MLOps for LLMs is WAY different from classic supervised learning. forget data drift -- you're fighting hallucination, latency, and rlly high costs

most beginners do need an example with a supervised learning ML service (which trust me you will mostly work on in big companies) so lmk if you want a separate post on that

anyways, here's full end to end process:

1) infra (using AWS cuz that's my shit but same concepts for any cloud service):

use CloudFormation or CDK but I always use CDK
- ex: https://t.co/LbBEvPjF5Z
- your stacks:
- compute (ECS or whatever u choose)
- networking (LBs, VPCs, etc.)
- monitoring (CloudWatch alarms, metrics, etc.)
- data (s3, permissions, auto scaling, etc.)
- git hooks for auto CDK diff checks or just use AWS cloudformation stack drift feature

2) model hosting (use SageMaker):
- single or multi-model endpoints (choose based on model size & memory needs)
- custom containers for deployment
- some type of cron job, stpe function, or rly any offline job to put your model .pt files in s3
- model reloading via S3 triggers or SNS or lambda or event bridge rules doesn't matter just something automatic
- separate endpoints for:
- prod traffic
- shadow testing
- canaries for testing integration

3) request pipeline (ur service):
- API Gateway for handling requests and auth
- Lambda or ECS depending on your problem
- rate limiters if u have enough traffic
- ElastiCache because reading from prod db = skill issue

4) monitoring (in real apps w real customers u need this):
- CloudWatch metrics tracking:
- p50/p90/p99 latency, server/client side error rates, etc.
- token usage ($$$ tracker basically)
- auto-rollbacks on:
- error rate > 1%
- p99 latency > 2s
- significant deviation in key performance metrics (very model-specific) tbh humans still should look at this part in LLM services

5) data pipeline:
- Step Functions for any offline preprocessing
- S3 for your processed data and model artifacts
- DB and cache of ur choice for:
- prompts
- response cache
- user feedback
- config

6) CI/CD:
CodePipeline with:
- auto tests
- canary analysis
- separate pipelines for:
- infra
- app code
- model updates
- prompts

To sum up:

this is what ML ops and infra looks like for people who are new to the topic -- it's just a lot of considering different things for your specific problem. very backend heavy. slight knowledge needed to understand intuition of your ML models which drive infra decisions

the MOST important thing isn't the tech stack -- it's knowing when to use what. you don't need kubernetes if you're serving 10 requests/day just like you don't need multi-region deployment for your side project nor auto rollbacks nor caching

drop a follow if this helped. I can do deep dives on any part where u want

ps: again, if ur new to ML ops stick with a supervised learning problem using something simple like a model that uses random forest or something that way you learn abuot data drift and actually versioning data in the pipeline","2024-11-18T21:34:54.000Z","https://x.com/yoobinray/status/1858624952280510805"

You'll do another unfulfilling task.
Your wife will complain you don't earn enough.
You'll be too tired even to play video games.

If you want to change all of that, here's my advice on how to find a Functional Programming job:

1. Learn an FP language. No, FP in TypeScript or Python doesn't count. You need to learn the essence of FP. I suggest OCaml, Haskell, Clojure or Elixir.

2. Join a FP community. FP jobs are so rare, they go away immediately as they appear. Usually, they don't even go to job boards, and are often posted in community forums, so you'd better monitor them! Besides, networking is essential.

3. Participate in OSS. Again, in FP, OSS communities are more active. Great for networking too.

4. Monitor FP job sites to see if there's anything relevant: https://t.co/QxsnV2oGc5

5. Apply for jobs. Even if you think you don't have relevant experience. People in FP communities perfectly understand that it's nigh impossible to get industrial experience with an FP language, so they're usually more flexible with requirements.

6. Prepare for a marathon. It's not a one-week process; it may take months or years. Getting your first FP job is hard, but getting your second FP job is no different from any other language.","2024-11-17T09:02:37.000Z","https://x.com/ChShersh/status/1858073246106628414"

Structured input is just as effective as structured outputs when building with LLMs.

Check out this new paper if you are working on RAG systems specifically.

It presents a novel approach that proposes using HTML instead of plain text as the format for building RAG systems.

The key finding is that preserving HTML structure provides richer semantic and structural information compared to plain text conversion, which typically loses important formatting like headings, tables, and semantic tags.

To address the challenge of HTML documents being too long for LLM context windows, the authors develop a two-step pruning method: first cleaning unnecessary HTML elements (reducing length by 94%), then using a block-tree-based pruning approach that combines embedding-based and generative pruning to further reduce the content while maintaining important information.

Experiments across six different QA datasets demonstrate that HtmlRAG outperforms existing plain-text-based methods, validating the advantages of preserving HTML structure in RAG systems.","2024-11-16T19:37:02.000Z","https://x.com/omarsar0/status/1857870511302390013"

Mind you, if you are sufficiently disciplined, you _can_ still do this in the GHC-style mutable variable approach, e.g. Kuan and McQueen track the equivalent of the ; count before you hit a variable in the context as its ""λ-rank"".

The main thing I like that his dissertation does is tear apart the big black box of Hindley-Milner style inference, and cleaves apart some things that are usually treated monolithically (e.g. unification) in such a fashion that it becomes much more obvious how to add functionality that doesn't fit the usual limitations of H-M.

GHC achieved much the same by formalizing  OutsideIn(X).

The zipper part is kind of cute, but I think falls out of just compiling and producing a witness in whatever core language you are using.","2024-11-16T18:59:32.000Z","https://x.com/kmett/status/1857861074218782806"

This is a top pain point we’ve heard from our community on multi-document RAG challenges - naive RAG returns fragmented context without awareness of the surrounding document. Our approach allows you to start off with a “simple” chunking technique (e.g. per page), but do a post-processing workflow to attach section/sub-section metadata.

You can then do GraphRAG-like retrieval (two-pass retrieval): retrieve chunks, look up the attached section metadata, and then do a second call to return all chunks that match the section ID.

Instead, exo in its most primitive form captured thousands of developer's imaginations. They worked through bugs, contributed hundreds of commits, and we are way further ahead than I ever thought we'd be at this stage. I definitely underestimated the power of the open source community.

1. write a training run in CUDA for some neural net you find cool. i started off w/ a single hidden layer MLP and gave myself a template to build from there

2. tinker w/ minecraft AI agents. multiple parts to this which make it even more fun (yes, you will get rapid dopamine hits while building). first you have to get an environment working (pixel output + action input) which i highly recommend ""minerl"" for . then you have to collect a bunch of training data in the form of minecraft video clips with actions each frame of the video (either your own or a massive corpus online -> also comes with minerl). next, you train the first neural net to take in a sequence of images from a video and you try to predict all the actions done in a given frame (say 7 frames total where the one you are trying to predict actions for is the middle frame -> temporal dimension helps performance). after this smaller neural net knows how to generate action labels from any given minecraft video, you can scrape thousands of hours of gameplay from youtube and run your small ""data generator"" neural net in inference mode to get yourself a nice dataset. then you test and tinker with different neural net architectures to actually attempt to reach goals in minecraft. you could use only neural nets, or neural nets w/ a mix of fixed algos (state machines, conditionals). 

3. mechanistic interpretability on computer vision networks and small language models. i personally started off by training an MLP from scratch on the mnist dataset up to around 98% accuracy then used matplotlib to print out the weights and activations in certain ways. helps you understand how neural nets form patterns internally in order to predict labels for the data you train it on. then you could use libraries like transformer_lens to visualize the attention heads at each layer for any given prompt in llms like gpt2-medium / small. if you're gonna go beyond that just looking at the raw patterns with your own eyes, consider playing with sparse autoencoders (if you find the resources hard to navigate just shoot me a dm). they essentially take a bunch of dense values in activations and project it to a sparse tensor format so you can map sparse signals to features (keywords you'll find here are: superposition/polysemanticity & dictionary learning).

4. fire up an instance with at least 2 3090s or 4090s and try to train a neural net of your choice across them with pytorch DDP (data distributed parallel) to give yourself an intro to distributed training/inference.

5. or if these sound crazy and you want a surprise, try implementing a neural net paper from arxiv in pytorch (a paper on ""differential attention"" came out recently which i'd like to mess around with. you could too)

6. if you think some resources need to be explained or documented better and you see the value in doing so, consider making a tutorial and posting it on X or youtube (i posted a few courses on the freecodecamp youtube channel and people liked them a lot). 

again, please send me a DM if you have any questions. would love to hear you out and possibly help steer you in the right direction based on your interests :)","2024-11-07T09:47:18.000Z","https://x.com/elliotarledge/status/1854460611872313718"

This is a minimal C file that implements the lazily evaluated HVM3 core. It currently performs ~58m interactions/s on Apple M3. It is slower than strict mode (~91m) due to laziness overhead, but is actually better than I expected. But can it be better?

TBH I don't think it can improve much because this example is memory bound, but, who knows; low level hackers are scary. Good sense will apply: the input/output has to be the same, you can't make the implementation incorrect, only the 1st gets paid, and so on.

1. We used (a JAX-implementation of) Muon to find coefficients for a 4-step Muon that behaves roughly the same as the original 5-step Muon. It's faster, but causes a slight perf drop for reasons I described in the quoted tweet. In collab w/ @kellerjordan0 & @YouJiacheng 

tl;dr: the singular values of (random) square matrices are close to 0, thus you need more iterations of Muon to pull them to +-1. And the majority of the weights in the model are square matrices.

Benchmark results: https://t.co/fmo0I0NOLX

JAX implementation of Muon: https://t.co/KweJGoRfw6

2. We found a slightly faster implementation of Muon. It only reduces training time by < 1s so it's not really worth bragging about, but the results might be more pronounced on larger models. c @YouJiacheng 

Training run logs: https://t.co/RsP34KB7oF

3. Started work on a fused kernel for Muon. The tensor diagram in the pic is the minimal I could come up with. But let me know if you can find better implementations!","2024-11-06T12:36:51.000Z","https://x.com/leloykun/status/1854140891386327450"

Yes, it was insane for the Democrats to think they could win by running a soulless candidate, without a shred of progressive policy vision, pursuing endorsements from neocon war-hawks everybody hates, while arming and funding a genocide, and belittling and crushing those who have enough morality to protest it.  It is enraging that the Democrats are so smug and blind to this.

But these are all just symptoms.  The deeper reality is that liberalism has failed, liberalism is dead, and people urgently need to wake up to this fact and respond accordingly. It is a defunct ideology that cannot offer any meaningful solutions to our social and ecological crises and it must be abandoned.

Democrats have proven over and over again that they cannot accept even *basic* steps like public healthcare, affordable housing, and a public job guarantee - things that would dramatically improve the material, social and political conditions of the working classes. And they cannot accept a public finance strategy that would steer production away from fossil fuels and toward green transition to give us a shot at a liveable future.

Why? Because these things run against the objectives of capital accumulation. And for liberals capital is sacrosanct. They will do whatever it takes to ensure elite accumulation, it is their only consistent commitment.  At home, they suppress and demonize progressive and socialist tendencies. Abroad, they engage in endless wars and violence to suppress input prices in the global South and prevent any possibility of sovereign economic development.

The Democrats have done all this purposefully and knowingly, for my whole life, not as some kind of ""mistake"" but in full consciousness that it is in the interests of capital.

And because liberalism cannot address our crises, and because it crushes socialist alternatives, it inevitably paves the way for right-wing populism.  They know this pattern, and yet they risk it every time - this election being only the most recent example. They did it in 2016, when they actively crushed the Sanders campaign and sent Trump to the White House. They do it because ultimately they (and I mean the liberal ruling class here) don't really mind if fascists take power, so long as the latter too ensure the conditions for capital accumulation. They 100% prefer this to the possibility of a socialist alternative.

So, progressives have to face reality. The dream of ""converting"" the Democratic party is dead. This is now a fact and it must be accepted. The only option is to build a mass-based movement that can reclaim the working classes and mobilize a political vehicle that can integrate disparate progressive struggles into a unified and formidable political force and achieve substantive transformation. This will take real work, actual organizing, but it must be done and that process must begin now.","2024-11-06T10:22:36.000Z","https://x.com/jasonhickel/status/1854107107743682797"

Not just ""looks good to me"", but a formal mathematical guarantee that it does what you want?

This formal verification is far too difficult for most programs we write, but for the most critical software in the world, it may be worth it. There's not much software more critical than AWS S3, which is why this paper on how they formally verify part of its internals is so interesting.

This paper focuses on one of the lowest-level, most complex, and most critical parts of S3-the storage node servers that persist object data on hard disks. When this paper was written, AWS was in the process of migrating to a new, higher-performance storage server implementation written in Rust, called ShardStore. Before moving critical customer data to ShardStore, they set out to formally prove its correctness.

The main goal of the verification effort is to prove the storage servers don't lose or corrupt data: they're durable in the absence of crashes and consistent in the presence of crashes or concurrency. 

The AWS team implemented verification in two main steps. First, they built reference models of their system that define its expected semantics. These are small executable specifications (1% of the size of the original) that are embedded in the code base and continuously updated alongside it. 

Then, they verify that the actual system has equivalent observable behaviors to the reference model. Generally, the way they did this was through highly sophisticated fuzzing, running tens of millions of automated tests on the real system with cleverly chosen inputs  and quickly validating that the observable semantics of the real system were equivalent to that of the reference model.  This is far more effective than regular fuzzing because the reference models allow rapidly checking if all the system's observable behaviors are correct.

This kind of verification work isn't easy to do (and it depends on correct reference models) and isn't suited for every application. But if half the world's infrastructure depends on what you're building, then it's good to have stronger guarantees your code is correct!","2024-11-03T18:58:47.000Z","https://x.com/petereliaskraft/status/1853149845349150745"

Normally this model would require around 276GB of VRAM at full precision. But just for the sake of it, you can run it on a 4GB GPU.

Or similarly you can run 405B Llama3.1 on 8GB VRAM.

And this by using airllm library and layered inference.

📌 The secret is the layer-wise inference which is essentially the ""divide and conquer"" approach 💡

Note, it will not be usable for any serious case, but this amazing repo just shows that its possible.

----

📌 The reason large language models are large is because, they occupy a lot of memory is mainly due to their structure containing many “layers.”

An LLM starts with an embedding projection layer, followed by numerous transformer layers, all identical.

A 70B class model has as many as 80 layers. But during inference, each layer is independent, relying only on the output of the previous layer.

Therefore, after running a layer, its memory can be released, keeping only the layer’s output. Based on this concept, AirLLM has implemented layered inference.

How ❓

During inference in a Transformer-based LLM, layers are executed sequentially. The output of the previous layer is the input to the next. Only one layer executes at a time.

Therefore, it is completely unnecessary to keep all layers in GPU memory. We can load whichever layer is needed from disk when executing that layer, do all the calculations, and then completely free the memory after.

This way, the GPU memory required per layer is only about the parameter size of one transformer layer, 1/80 of the full model, around 1.6GB.

📌 Then using flash attention to deeply optimizes cuda memory access to achieve multi-fold speedups

📌 shard model-files by layers.

📌 Use the meta device feature provided by HuggingFace Accelerate. When you load a model via meta device, the model data is not actually read in, only the code is loaded. Memory usage is 0.

📌 Provides options for doing quantization with a `compression` param

`compression`: supported options: 4bit, 8bit for 4-bit or 8-bit block-wise quantization","2024-10-31T03:30:01.000Z","https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1851828950315774208"

In order of quickest time payoff/seriousness.

1. The 'High School Robotics' route: 
- Have access to a 3D printer, some servos, an arduino, and have at it. 
- Make something that moves. Doesn't matter if it's useful. 
-You'll learn to CAD, assembly pains, and how things don't break. This project will finally get you using your hands! It will scratch that hardware itch you've started to develop.

2. The Simulation route: 
-You can take these open MIT Robotics courses by Russ Tedrake (Manipulation, Underactuated Robotics). He is the author of the Drake robotic simulation library, and his classes allow you to follow along and learn to simulate stuff using it. Alternatively you can learn Mujoco. 
- @alexkoch_ai has opensource robotic arms that you can teach in sim! A great exercise that can transition into hardware at an affordable pricepoint (250USD).  
-I recommend giving @VilleKuosmanen a follow if this kind of approach appeals to you.

3. Synthesis: Fuck it, dive into the deep end. Design your own robot, put the CAD into a Sim, write the software, teach it to move, do everything! @_Stocko_ is a great example of someone doing this and documenting it.","2024-10-28T10:43:25.000Z","https://x.com/matbogus/status/1850850856075227415"

I get such remarks all the time! Recently more so since there are many new things I'm learning in databases and systems programming. I find them fascinating, make notes about them, and apply them. However, none of this was ever required when I was writing backend systems.  

When you join @recursecenter, they have an introductory meeting on day one. It's the only mandatory RC activity. They explain RC's social rules, one of which is ""no showing surprise.""  

The RC manual elaborates what this means:  
You shouldn't act surprised when people say they don't know something. This applies to both technical things (""What?! I can't believe you don't know what the stack is!"") and non-technical things (""You don't know who RMS is?!"").

Parquet (in S3) has become a universal data storage and exchange format. We felt it was time for PostgreSQL to support Parquet.

pg_parquet extends the COPY TO/FROM commands in Postgres to import/export Parquet files in S3 or local disk, with roles to control read/write access, released under the PostgreSQL license!

It is written in Rust using pgrx and basically supports all PostgreSQL types, including composite types, arrays, and PostGIS geometry (stored as WKB).

With pg_parquet, you can for example archive old time partitions into S3, import public and private data sets, move data between PostgreSQL servers without direct connectivity, or prepare your data for analytics.","2024-10-17T16:00:03.000Z","https://x.com/marcoslot/status/1846944271749800405"

1. tinygrad searches its kernels. tinygrad uses BEAM search and soon MCTS to search for optimal kernels. You only have to write a small amount of code for each accelerator, instead of a hodgepodge of handwritten kernels. https://t.co/uKJDuaDn3V","3 Reasons Why @__tinygrad__  Will Win The ML Library War.

1. tinygrad searches its kernels. tinygrad uses BEAM search and soon MCTS to search for optimal kernels. You only have to write a small amount of code for each accelerator, instead of a hodgepodge of handwritten kernels. This avoids the combinatorial nightmare of one kernel per combination of device, operation and quantization (other libs have 1000's of unique kernels). You end up with faster kernels this way too if the search is good, especially for anything that's ""off the beaten path"" where a human expert hasn't put thousands of hours into optimising the kernels.

2. tinygrad is small. It's <10k lines of code so you can actually understand what's going on. You can go in there and change stuff. Less code also means less bugs: the rule of thumb is ~1 bug per 100 LoC. The architecture is simple and clean (see the architecture diagram). Proof: I implemented distributed training from scratch with 4 Mac Minis over thunderbolt in 6 hours at a hackathon without knowing anything about tinygrad before the hackathon -- good luck doing this from scratch in PyTorch.

3. tinygrad is lazy. This simplifies a lot of things for example stream executing a model from disk -- that kinda just works out of the box because tensors are lazy. This design also enables tinygrad to aggressively fuse operations, ending up with faster kernels.","2024-10-15T19:25:05.000Z","https://x.com/alexocheema/status/1846271094631944552"

Recently, @PrimeIntellect have announced their 10B distributed learning (https://t.co/CqIRQeiLlV), what is it exactly?

Going back to the origin, Federated Learning (FL, https://t.co/E6hP7PW4ol) aims to train a model across a fleet of phones. To handle the low bandwidth between them, the gist is that each phone will perform multiple training steps (forward/backward & update) independently from each other. After a hundred of steps, each phone's replica of the model computes its trajectory (aka an outer gradient): it's simply a delta in the parameters space between where the model is now vs where it was at first. 

Then, an all-reduce (thus no need of centralized server!) averages all the replicas outer gradients. Thus the peak communication is as high as in data-parallel (https://t.co/m5kZdW65Vs), but because it's only done rarely, its cost is amortized. 

Now, those ""outer gradients"" are quite different from your classical gradients, but we can actually use an optimizer on those! FedOpt (https://t.co/K9tdwmWrXw) proposes to optimize it with Adam, further accelerating training.

Most of the FL algorithms used however as inner/local optimizer SGD. This is suboptimal to train current large-scale transformer. In DiLoCo (https://t.co/q21VQaxLSJ) from my team at @GoogleDeepMind, we use Adam as inner optimizer, but more importantly Nesterov as outer optimizer -- this simple change is ridiculously powerful:

With DiLoCo, you can now be as flops/token efficient as data-parallel training while using two orders of magnitude less bandwidth. A bunch of papers (https://t.co/OwZwsT2Qgv, https://t.co/cLGQEpa0Ky, https://t.co/ykctgYWdIO) have then re-used that winning recipes on large-scale transformers, including OpenDiLoCo.

In particular, OpenDiLoCo from @PrimeIntellect, is training a 10B (!) DiLoCo model across the world using Hivemind (https://t.co/ffNYHBB1HW), while synchronizing every 100 steps, and downcasting the outer gradients in int8. That's a 400x bandwidth reduction. This reduction is so big that, as @samsja19 noted, their speed bottleneck now is checkpointing on disk, not communication. 

Godspeed @PrimeIntellect! 🫡

The other approach that has been made somewhat public is Distro from @NousResearch. For now, there is very little details, so it's hard to say how legit it is (read their report). But we know that one of the trick used is adding a regularization loss, forcing all replicas to stay close towards the global model that is synced once in a while. This is very reminiscent of ElasticSDG (https://t.co/ZQDQ6gbclF @ylecun) and FedProx (https://t.co/eNmRmjfcCZ), which have also been re-visited recently with PAPA (https://t.co/g6ISWub9kx).

I strongly suspect it is still combined with some kind of outer optimization, in order to remain flops-efficient. We'll see.

The main point of this post is to show that there is very little new things in the recent distributed works, but that i think a lot of research on federated/distributed was artificial and done on toy settings. Now, the time is ripe for distributed training, see this @SemiAnalysis_ post: https://t.co/cZ51k2XdOw. There is lot of alpha into re-visiting past ideas, and investing heavily on the engineering parts to make them work, for real, at scale.","2024-10-14T10:09:31.000Z","https://x.com/Ar_Douillard/status/1845768893299585420"

You will be averse to this because it wasn't how you learned math and programming. But if you want to actually understand this body of knowledge, converse with scientists and identify real problems in a field that will certainly be a big part of our future, this is the way.

Leinster's text on Category Theory opens its section on set theory with a section that stuck with me. ""It is not important that the black king is a piece of wood... What matters is what the black king does."" In some fields, true fluency with the material and durable knowledge only comes from solving problems and focusing on the structure of interaction between objects. All of the details - memory of notation, properties of objects, supporting lemmas - fall in place from the precise thinking required to work out proofs. Memorizing these things on their own is useless (and unecessary).

Biology is not engineering or math. It is actually very important here that the ""black king is a piece of wood"" because we are generally studying the black king itself. While the goal is to eventually understand the rules that govern the vast networks of biochemistry that compose living systems, modern biology is still concerned with identifying and labeling all the different pieces. 

When you start to recognize the pieces, you realize that many problems of great value in bioengineering are really quite simple in structure. Can you find some chunk of biomolecular state, eg. transcripts, proteins, even populations of cells, that change with and are ideally causal of disease? The difficulty lies in how slow and expensive it is to answer this question, not because the answer has some complex structure. (This is mostly limited by poor tooling, the assays that measure and synthesize molecules, and this is getting better.)

That is why so much learning happens through papers, twitter, conferences, walks with colleagues through Kendall square, clinical trial results, even fundraising announcements. We are learning what the pieces do through the work of others. To do this, it is critical to remember their names (FoxP3, CD8, cytochrome c).

So to those that want to work with computers to build new tools in biology, focus and retain the molecular details:

- Conversations with scientists become detailed, fluid and fun
- Papers become legible and so do deeper problems and questions
- Knowledge compounds. Every paper, conversation, clinical milestone updates your understanding of basic biology and the landscape of therapeutic strategies

I know very talented engineers who dismiss this as menial and uninteresting work, and to those who feel the same, remember what we are trying to do. Our goal is to learn a body of knowledge in earnest towards having an impact on scientific progress and not compete in some intellectual olympics. 

Our ambitions for this field (eg. cures, consumer biologics, terraforming) rely on an influx of technical talent from other industries and academic disciplines over the next few decades. It is incredibly important that we encourage more engineers, mathematicians, even heartless hedgefund traders to get excited about and really learn this material.","2024-10-13T03:09:51.000Z","https://x.com/kenbwork/status/1845300893396369841"

1. It must invert *keys* (""bit-reversal permutation"")
2. It must be a dependency-free, pure recursive function
3. It must have type `Bit -> Tree -> Tree`

These small changes are enough to move this problem out of the ""memorized solution zone"". It isn't on the internet. And, guess what? This is enough to make it completely intractable to modern AIs. All of them fail miserably at it, no matter how you prompt it.

This is very relevant, because the problem is still easy to a human researcher, and being capable of solving it is clear pre-requisite to contribute to CS research. Yet, all modern AIs fail miserably. As much as I love LLMs, truth is: they do NOT reason, and they will never do CS.

Some prompts for you to try:

Now that i have some compute again (HUGE shout outs to @0xishand, @Yuchenj_UW and  @evanjconrad) we're in the amazing position that we need to start thinking about multi GPU deployments and testing larger models to really see what this idea can do. However, most people wont use or care about that additional complexity. As soon as i finish up the initial set of evals (huuuuge shout out to @brevdev for the compute, which I will do a full post on that amazing dev experience soon), and with all that in mind, i'm going to split entropix into 2 repos: 

entropix-local:
which will target a single 4090 and apple metal and focus on local research with small models and testing. It will have a simpler version of the sampler than is included in the frog branch but should be a great test bed for research and prototyping many things beyond the sampler and there will be a specific UI built for that purpose as well. There will be fully maintained jax, pytorch and mlx versions of the code. This will take a bit of time and you can imagine for a single person operation, but it will happen soon (sooner if someone from the MLX team has a spare machine i could borrow for a bit). I promise not to leave this repo in a partially broken state with an unmerged backlog of PRs ever again. 

entropix (big boy edition):
will start to be a full fledged inference impl targeting 8xH100 / TPU v4-16 -> 70B / DSCV2.5 and tpuv4-64  -> 405B. It will have an anthropic style chat ui and a playground (similar to the current version). We will exclusively target jax for TPU and pytorch for GPU. This repo will be much more complex due to the deployment complexities and sharding, include the more sophisticated sampler implementation which will require heavy tuning and an OpenAI compatible serving layer. 

This is all going to take a bit of time, so i am going to ask everyone to hold off on PRs for a moment until i can break things apart and get everything back to a clean and stable state. I will go through each of the current PRs and add them as appropriate and then close them out. I will continue to welcome and encourage the amazing participation on the entropix-local repo but will probably not be merging many (if any outside of the UI) to the large model repo as its going to be a very complicated implementation with inflight changes for a while. 

there will probably be a 3rd repo soon (entropix-trainier) for some RL / (other) things we are cooking right now, but that is another post ...

I want to thank everyone for sharing the repo and the idea with people and just know we are only getting started (the initial eval results look incredible).","2024-10-10T17:01:37.000Z","https://x.com/_xjdr/status/1844423049359262164"

Accessing disks or the network used to take many milliseconds, now it takes microseconds. What would it take to build an OS that can handle these speeds--a nanosecond-scale OS architecture?

I really like this paper because it attempts to provide OS abstractions for ultra-fast hardware. Right now, the overhead of going through the kernel is vastly higher than datacenter network latency, so ultra-fast programs must bypass the kernel altogether and access hardware directly. But this is a nightmare to program because it means code is hardware-dependent, and so has to be rewritten for every machine it runs on.

The Demikernel solves this problem by providing a high-level OS interface for ultra-fast (kernel-bypass) I/O. This is tricky because it has to handle a variety of hardware and kernel-bypass strategies, carefully coordinate memory accesses across the I/O device, stack, and application, and multiplex CPUs at nanosecond timescales.

The solution is to provide library OSes based around PDPIX, an extension of POSIX designed to support ultra-fast I/O. PDPIX replaces POSIX's pipes with I/O queues to allow applications to submit entire requests at once. It also incorporates coroutines (essentially, async/await) to allow ultra-fast CPU context switching.

The big takeaway is that incredible hardware performance is of limited utility if there aren't good abstractions to use it. Hopefully OS researchers will keep making kernel bypass easier so we can all take full advantage of how fast computers are becoming!","2024-10-06T18:28:15.000Z","https://x.com/petereliaskraft/status/1842995300035879080"

1) Prompt Optimizer: By evaluating the attention entropy   after the prefill stage, you can optimize your prompt towards a low entropy state. This also extends to ICL and RAG. There is now a measurable target to see how well the model understands the input, per head, per layer, beyond just evaluating the output tokens

2) Steering Vector training loop: Instead of measuring the general direction of similar prompts and injecting steering vectors to drive further in that direction, you can now train the control vectors with an objective of lowering entropy in the attention heads as well as directly driving activations towards lower entropy state

3) Significantly improvement of narrative consistency issues due to entropy collapse for long generation lengths: We introduce just enough entropy to prevent collapse while still driving towards consistent (low varentropy) outputs. We could substantially improve this by introducing and combining logits from a base model as well, but even the sampler only version has had surprising improvements in capabilities, especially for the small model we are mostly testing on

4) Reduce Hallucinations: Instead of randomly sampling over a distribution of low probability logits, we can now drive the model to either dig deeper via branching until it is confident or to eventually the only thing it will be sure of is an eot token, which is ideal. 

There are many more interesting things i have observed up to this point, so many in fact that  i am almost ready to say that even if we do not make any more progress on reasoning (we are and we will), just the improvements outlined above would lead this new technique to be, in my opinion,  a wild success.

In the before times, i would run a set of evals on every github push to measure improvements / regressions in order to guide next steps, so it looks like we might be at the point in this project where doing that might be the most important next thing to work on.  I need to measure entropy and consistency over a large number and wide variety of prompts and I need to run actual evals against argmax and nucleus sampling baselines over a variety of evals and tasks.

I am not prepared to say we have achieved anything at this time, but everything i have seen up to this point leads me to believe that this could be something worth spending some real dedicated time on and that has a good chance of leading to improved model capabilities in the long run","2024-10-05T22:45:17.000Z","https://x.com/_xjdr/status/1842697597842252163"

""system"" in quotes because I simulate it in my library (""<SystemPrompt>...</SystemPrompt> <UserMessage>...</UserMessage> Using the system prompt, answer the user's message."") — o1-preview doesn't support system prompts out of the box.

Credit where its due: I combed thru claude-engineer a few months ago, and distilled it as best I could, then implemented my own coding agent (ReactUI + CLI to add folders/files as context including *.md prompt files like Cursor folks do, then use the ReactUI to filter via exclude/include regex filters, and chat.)

Compared to things like aider and mentat (both open-source coders), claude-engineer is 1 file and much easier to understand.

At this point, I have many agents (100+ since I use Obsidian to define them in 30 seconds, often on demand), I'll manually hot-swap between them mid-conversation, so that the ""active"" agent has minimum set of tools and minimum necessary context — to maximize clarity to the AI.

Typically for coding, I want only 1 function-call: EditFile (new files are also EditFile operations).

With gpt-4o and sonnet-3.5, we benefitted from multi-step reasoning -- have a planner, then delegate to each file to generate EditFiles via a secondary LLM call via either FunctionCalling or response_format param.

But with o1-preview, you just need 1 call, for multiple files (and multiple edits per file). And you're usually done.

Most of the work was building the broader agent system (not just for coding, but for everything) — to have a nice UI, CLI (add files/folders via command line), be multi-modal (screenshots don't work yet for o1), work with all the platforms (Anthropic, Gemini, OpenAI, Groq) on both function-calling/streaming, integrate well with both a Code Repo and Knowledge Repo (Obsidian).

Excited for o1-engineer, to compare notes! You have a really unique and useful approach — I hope it's still 1 file!

With o1-preview, the key is that the <Find> block might fail to match perfectly. With smaller models, you can try to self-heal.

But o1-preview is slow enough, where you can try to recover by downgrading to smaller models at self-heal step, or I actually just pop-up a UI Modal that clearly displays the failures (error, Find chunk, Replace chunk, file — 1 click to open that file in Cursor, 1 click to copy the Replace chunk)

I wonder how you'll solve this — looking forward to it, as always!

```
You're an AI coding assistant.

Come up with a plan, with code snippets.
- Explain your design decisions
- Clearly state the changes needed, with reasoning behind each change
- Anticipate potential issues that might arise
- Maintain existing code style

Generate proposed changes via <WriteFile /> and <EditFile /> tags, while organizing files well.

For each file change, specify full path, and use the following format:

<EditFile path=""/path/to/new_file.py"">
<Insert>
```python
print('yo4')
```
</Insert>
</EditFile>

<EditFile path=""/path/to/existing_file.py"">
<Find>
```python
print('yo3')
```
</Find>
<Insert>
```python
print('yo4')
```
</Insert>
</EditFile>

On EditFile format:
- <Find/> is the code snippet to search for in the file. Include enough context to uniquely identify the code to be changed.
- If creating new file entirely, omit the <Find/> tag entirely.
- <Insert/> is the code snippet to replace the <Find/> content with. Provide the exact replacement code, maintaining correct indentation and formatting.
- Do not include comments like ""// Rest of existing code here...""
- Focus on specific, targeted changes rather than large, sweeping modifications

Respond in GitHub markdown format.

I really like this brand-new paper on Aurora Serverless because it goes into great detail on resource management, a problem that's hard to study academically because it's highly workload-dependent and only really becomes an issue at large scale.

Some key challenges serverless Aurora faces are:
- How to tell if a database instance is ""hot"" (overloaded) and needs to be scaled up
- How to assign instances to hosts, balancing capacity to scale up instances with high resource utilization.
- How to do live migrations of instances to new hosts if their current hosts lack capacity.

Solving these problems requires a complex resource management system that carefully balances performance-utilization tradeoffs. Here are some key takeaways from its design:
- Resources are both over-provisioned and over-subscribed. Each database's resource allocation is slightly more than the database actually needs, so it can instantaneously scale up to handle small spikes in load. On the other hand, to ensure resource efficiency, host servers are slightly oversubscribed, with fewer CPUs than those allocated to their VMs.
- The rate at which databases can scale up is tightly controlled via token buckets to prevent a fast-scaling database from overwhelming its host. The parameters behind this regulation are empirically set from vast amounts of usage data.
- If a database grows too large for its host, it is migrated live to a different host. To make this possible, some hosts are kept deliberately underprovisioned so they have capacity to take in a new large database.","2024-09-26T18:00:08.000Z","https://x.com/petereliaskraft/status/1839364347216421074"

(And why should anyone working with RAG over PDFs care?)

ColPali makes information retrieval from complex document types - like PDFs - easier.

Information retrieval from PDFs is hard because they contain various components: 
Text, images, tables, different headings, captions, complex layouts, etc.

For this, parsing PDFs currently requires multiple complex steps:
1. OCR
2. Layout recognition
3. Figure captioning
4. Chunking
5. Embedding

Not only are these steps complex and time-consuming, but they are also prone to error.

This is where ColPali comes into play.

But what is ColPali?

ColPali combines: 
• Col -> the contextualized late interaction mechanism introduced in ColBERT 
• Pali -> with a Vision Language Model (VLM), in this case, PaliGemma

And how does it work?
During indexing, the complex PDF parsing steps are replaced by using ""screenshots"" of the PDF pages directly. 
These screenshots are then embedded with the VLM. At inference time, the query is embedded and matched with a late interaction mechanism to retrieve the most similar document pages.

Here are some more resources to learn more about ColPali:

FINALLY RELEASED!!!

😃😃😃😄😊😊❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️

This has been a long journey, and I sincerely hope this book will make a significant contribution to the functional programming world. 🎇🎇

❓ Who is this book for? It's for all developers interested in practical functional programming. This book is useful for software architects, senior developers, and everyone else. The model language is Haskell, but the ideas are universal and applicable to languages like Scala, OCaml, F#, and even C# and C++.

❓What is this book about? It’s about applying an engineering approach to functional programming. Design patterns, design principles, application architectures, best practices, approaches, and deep ideas—all combined into a comprehensive and highly consistent methodology for building real-world applications.

📔 Functional Design and Architecture is structured, consistent, well-written, and approachable. I’ve made a special effort to ensure the content is accessible to a wide audience. The narrative is engaging, free of jargon and complex mathematics, and progresses in a friendly, gradual manner.

💡 The ideas are universal; some were known before, but many were developed throughout this project. There was a significant knowledge gap, and this book covers much of it for our benefit.

A titanic amount of work went into this book. Specifically, the following were created:

🟠 A full-fledged application framework, Hydra;
🔴 A proof-of-concept platform for creating spaceship management scenarios;
🟡 The methodology of Functional Declarative Design, covering various aspects of design and software architecture in functional programming;
🟢 A unique architectural approach, Hierarchical Free Monads;
🔵 A multitude of new design patterns, approaches, and practices, in addition to those that already existed;
🟣 Several demo applications, included both in the book and in the Hydra framework;
🟤 A wealth of accompanying material: articles, talks, and side projects;
⚪️ And of course, these ideas have been successfully tested in practice in several places.

You'll also find many links to other valuable resources in this book because the subject is very broad and deep. I am especially grateful to all those who initiated this movement toward the practical application of functional programming. I stand on the shoulders of giants and deeply appreciate their contributions. On the cover, you’ll find testimonials from these distinguished individuals:

🟡 @ScottWlaschin, author of Domain Modeling Made Functional (Pragmatic Bookshelf)
🟤 @debasishg, author of Functional and Reactive Domain Modeling and DSLs in Action (both from Manning)
🟣 @VBragilevsky  @_bravit , author of Haskell in Depth (Manning)

I hope you enjoy the book as much as I enjoyed writing it.

By installing ""temporal extensions,"" you can track the history of your data over time; or you can implement this feature using triggers (check out this blog post). Time travel queries are particularly useful for debugging and auditing, as they allow you to view the database ""as of"" a specific point in the past or audit your application data by querying what changed and when. However, be aware of several caveats.

First, the main issue is that most implementations store all past versions of your data in the same database as your application. As the historical data grows, this can lead to performance bottlenecks and high storage costs, and time travel queries may consume excessive compute resources. To mitigate this, you need to periodically clean up old versions to minimize storage overhead and reduce any potential impact on your application's performance.

Second, you'll need to carefully manage the schemas of your history tables, ensuring they remain consistent with your application's tables. If they fall out of sync, changes might not be captured and can lead to silent corruption of your history tables. This can be a lot of effort when you want to add/update/remove columns.

To address these limitations, I propose an alternative solution in DBOS. At the upcoming @pgconfnyc, I'll present a new implementation of time travel queries in Postgres that uses logical replication to create a separate versioned database, which has minimal impact on the application's main database. Plus, I'll explain how to support a unique feature called time travel debugging for transactions.","2024-09-22T19:17:47.000Z","https://x.com/qianl_cs/status/1837934336722849956"

Hybrid prefetching combines the https://t.co/KgC3N98TRP","Hybrid Prefetching: Memory Performance with Hardware and Software
I already have written about Hardware and Software Prefetching, I will attach these links in the comments below. Today, we will be taking a look into the Hybrid Prefetching.

Hybrid prefetching combines the strengths of both hardware and software prefetching to achieve superior performance across a wide range of applications and memory access patterns. This approach leverages the transparency and low overhead of hardware prefetching while utilizing the precision and flexibility of software prefetching. 

Hybrid prefetching systems often involve multiple layers of prefetching, with hardware handling common cases and software providing additional prefetches or hints for complex patterns.

Key Components of Hybrid Prefetching:
1. Hardware Prefetcher: The built-in prefetching mechanisms in the processor.

2. Software Prefetch Instructions: Explicit prefetch instructions are inserted into the code.

3. Prefetch Hint Mechanism: The communication channel between software prefetch instructions and the hardware prefetcher is the prefetch hint mechanism. 

This mechanism defines how software instructions convey information about future data accesses to the hardware prefetcher. This could involve specifying the memory address to prefetch, the desired cache level, or even the expected access pattern (sequential, strided, etc).

4. Runtime Prefetch Adjustment: A static prefetching strategy might not be optimal for all situations. Runtime prefetch adjustment introduces dynamic feedback loops that monitor prefetching effectiveness. 

If the prefetcher frequently fetches unnecessary data (cache pollution) or fails to predict accurately, the system can adjust its behavior on-the-fly. This adaptability ensures the prefetcher remains efficient across various program behaviors and dynamic workloads.
Strategies for Hybrid Prefetching
Hybrid prefetching strategies represent a sophisticated approach to minimizing memory latency by combining the strengths of both hardware and software prefetching. In complementary prefetching, the hardware prefetcher, adept at recognizing simple, regular access patterns, handles those while the software prefetcher, guided by program semantics, tackles more complex, irregular access patterns that the hardware might miss. 

Cooperative prefetching takes a different approach, with software prefetch instructions providing explicit hints to guide the hardware prefetcher towards data likely to be needed soon. Adaptive prefetching introduces a dynamic decision-making process. 

The system continuously monitors the effectiveness of both hardware and software prefetching and, based on runtime conditions and observed accuracy, dynamically switches between them to maximize performance. 

Finally, hierarchical prefetching recognizes that different levels of the memory hierarchy (L1, L2, L3 caches, main memory) benefit from tailored prefetching strategies. It employs distinct strategies at each level, optimizing data movement and minimizing stalls across the entire memory system. 

These hybrid strategies, often used in combination, represent a powerful toolset for improving the performance of memory-intensive applications.

Let's look at C code that shows different ways to use hybrid prefetching:
Here each example demonstrates various hybrid prefetching techniques:
complementary_prefetch: Combines hardware prefetching for simple patterns with software prefetching for complex ones.
cooperative_prefetch: Provides hints to the hardware prefetcher while also using software prefetching as a fallback.
adaptive_prefetch: Dynamically chooses between hardware and software prefetching based on observed effectiveness.
hierarchical_prefetch: Applies different prefetching strategies for different cache levels.
multi_threaded_prefetch: Uses helper threads to perform prefetching in parallel with the main computation.

Here are a few papers if you are looking for interesting weekend reads:

- Diagram of Thought (DoT): Enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through mathematical rigor. DAT models iterative reasoning in LLM as the construction of a directed acyclic graph. It integrates propositions, critiques, refinement, and verification into a unified DAG structure; this allows DoT to capture complex logical deduction beyond linear or tree-based approaches. https://t.co/3mFtM4neHT

- To CoT or not to CoT? - Investigates what kinds of tasks benefit the most from chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. After a meta-analysis on 100+ papers and several evaluations, it finds that CoT produces strong performance benefits primarily on tasks involving math and logic. They find that most of the CoT gain comes from improving symbolic execution, but a symbolic solver outperforms it. https://t.co/zfOYBrJeik

- Iteration of Thought: Proposes the Iteration of Thought (IoT) framework to enhance the LLM responses and reasoning capabilities with adaptive reasoning paths. It leverages an inner dialogue agent, acting as a guide, to dynamically adjust reasoning paths which allows adaptive cross-path exploration and enhance response accuracy. It's different from CoT and ToT (both rigid processes) in that its prompt generation is a dynamic process that allows it to adapt. https://t.co/ggCoxPHYQo

- Training LLMs to Self-Correct via RL: Develops a multi-turn online reinforcement learning to improve the capabilities of an LLM to self-correct. It’s based entirely on self-generated data; SFT is shown to be ineffective at learning self-correction and suffers from distribution mismatch between training data and model responses. Proposes a two-stage approach that first optimizes correction behavior and then uses a reward bonus to amplify self-correction during training. When applied to Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, it achieves state-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models’ self-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on the MATH and HumanEval benchmarks. https://t.co/xsoxGIgVjS

- Math Jailbreaking Prompts: Uses GPT-4o to generate mathematically encoded prompts that serve as an effective jailbreaking technique. Shows an average attack success rate of 73.6% across 13 state-of-the-art. This highlights the inability of existing safety training mechanisms to generalize to mathematically encoded inputs.  https://t.co/o75QMEIdEg

RAG_Techniques is an open source project started by Nir Diamant that is gaining huge popularity recently, 6K+ stars in one month!

I had the pleasure of talking with Nir to hear his story.

It all started because of Covid.

Earlier this year, Nir got Covid and was stuck at home. He decided to use the time to really get into RAG, especially advanced techniques. As he was studying, he decided to implement each advanced RAG technique he came across as a notebook, from scratch, with detailed explanation and documentation.

Then from 1 notebook, to 5 notebooks, to 10 notebooks, to 20+ notebooks, covering a wide range of advanced RAG techniques.

The result:

A one-of-the kind repo where every one of the 20+ notebooks in the repo were written by Nir with the same highest standard in terms of coding style, documentation, explanation, and figures.

In comparison, existing resources are often a random collection of notebooks authored by different people with varying degrees of quality and usability.

One day, Nir decided to share all of his notebooks on Github!

Quickly, people started to notice. The repo became very popular in a short amount of time.

Other people started to contribute too.

Moreover, I found some of the advanced techniques I covered in my previous webinar on RAG are included:

• Query Transformations
• Reranking
• Contextual Compression
• Hypothetical Document Embedding

I put together a side-by-side comparison and wanted to share with you!

I hope my drawings help you understand the concept of these techniques, and Nir's notebooks help you implement them in practice!","2024-09-20T14:10:02.000Z","https://x.com/ProfTomYeh/status/1837132113218293933"

3. High performance, predictable.

2. Clojure
3. Rust
4. OCaml
5. Haskell
6. Prolog

To elaborate:

1. Kotlin is great to start because it's relatively easy to start. You have a nice IDE with a debugger, lots of resources and courses. And you might even stop here if you want to develop for mobiles. It's a nice language with C-like syntax and garbage collect, so you have to worry less.

2. Clojure still uses JVM and has nice IDE support, so it's easier to move from a JVM language to this one. Clojure (being a Lisp-like language) gives a completely different perspective on coding, as well as dynamic typing.

3. Rust is the first language that doesn't have a garbage collector. But if you're familiar with diverse languages such as Kotlin and Clojure, you shouldn't be too scared by manual memory management and borrow checker. Besides, learning resources are great.

4. OCaml offers a completely different perspective, being a statically typed FP language from an ML family. It gives you another perspective on programming with the taste of native FP via ADTs, HOFs, a Hindley-Milner type system and many other goodies.

5. Haskell teaches you the concept of pure functional programming, moving your understanding even further. After Haskell, you'll have no choice but to understand monads.

6. Prolog teaches you the paradigm of logical programming, and it can be really powerful in understanding diverse programming concepts.

---

After all, everyone's journey is unique. And there's not one-size-fits-all answer. Something else might work significantly better for you. But I think that it's crucial to have an exposure to diverse ideas.

Besides, it'll teach you to learn PLs extremely fast. After this list, learning Python, Java, C#, or Scala is a matter of reading a language spec for one evening.","2024-09-17T14:04:16.000Z","https://x.com/ChShersh/status/1836043498140696951"

As Sutton said in the Bitter Lesson, there're only 2 techniques that scale indefinitely with compute: learning & search. It's time to shift focus to the latter. 

1. You don't need a huge model to perform reasoning. Lots of parameters are dedicated to memorizing facts, in order to perform well in benchmarks like trivia QA. It is possible to factor out reasoning from knowledge, i.e. a small ""reasoning core"" that knows how to call tools like browser and code verifier. Pre-training compute may be decreased.

2. A huge amount of compute is shifted to serving inference instead of pre/post-training. LLMs are text-based simulators. By rolling out many possible strategies and scenarios in the simulator, the model will eventually converge to good solutions. The process is a well-studied problem like AlphaGo's monte carlo tree search (MCTS).

3. OpenAI must have figured out the inference scaling law a long time ago, which academia is just recently discovering. Two papers came out on Arxiv a week apart last month:

- Large Language Monkeys: Scaling Inference Compute with Repeated Sampling. Brown et al. finds that DeepSeek-Coder increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples on SWE-Bench, beating Sonnet-3.5.
- Scaling LLM Test-Time Compute Optimally can be More Effective than Scaling Model Parameters. Snell et al. finds that PaLM 2-S beats a 14x larger model on MATH with test-time search. 

4. Productionizing o1 is much harder than nailing the academic benchmarks. For reasoning problems in the wild, how to decide when to stop searching? What's the reward function? Success criterion? When to call tools like code interpreter in the loop? How to factor in the compute cost of those CPU processes? Their research post didn't share much.

5. Strawberry easily becomes a data flywheel. If the answer is correct, the entire search trace becomes a mini dataset of training examples, which contain both positive and negative rewards. 

This in turn improves the reasoning core for future versions of GPT, similar to how AlphaGo’s value network — used to evaluate quality of each board position — improves as MCTS generates more and more refined training data.","2024-09-12T17:16:13.000Z","https://x.com/DrJimFan/status/1834279865933332752"

There are a lot of videos on YouTube/TikTok etc. that give the appearance of education, but if you look closely they are really just entertainment. This is very convenient for everyone involved : the people watching enjoy thinking they are","# on shortification of ""learning""

There are a lot of videos on YouTube/TikTok etc. that give the appearance of education, but if you look closely they are really just entertainment. This is very convenient for everyone involved : the people watching enjoy thinking they are learning (but actually they are just having fun). The people creating this content also enjoy it because fun has a much larger audience, fame and revenue. But as far as learning goes, this is a trap. This content is an epsilon away from watching the Bachelorette. It's like snacking on those ""Garden Veggie Straws"", which feel like you're eating healthy vegetables until you look at the ingredients.

Learning is not supposed to be fun. It doesn't have to be actively not fun either, but the primary feeling should be that of effort. It should look a lot less like that ""10 minute full body"" workout from your local digital media creator and a lot more like a serious session at the gym. You want the mental equivalent of sweating. It's not that the quickie doesn't do anything, it's just that it is wildly suboptimal if you actually care to learn.

I find it helpful to explicitly declare your intent up front as a sharp, binary variable in your mind. If you are consuming content: are you trying to be entertained or are you trying to learn? And if you are creating content: are you trying to entertain or are you trying to teach? You'll go down a different path in each case. Attempts to seek the stuff in between actually clamp to zero.

So for those who actually want to learn. Unless you are trying to learn something narrow and specific, close those tabs with quick blog posts. Close those tabs of ""Learn XYZ in 10 minutes"". Consider the opportunity cost of snacking and seek the meal - the textbooks, docs, papers, manuals, longform. Allocate a 4 hour window. Don't just read, take notes, re-read, re-phrase, process, manipulate, learn.

And for those actually trying to educate, please consider writing/recording longform, designed for someone to get ""sweaty"", especially in today's era of quantity over quality. Give someone a real workout. This is what I aspire to in my own educational work too. My audience will decrease. The ones that remain might not even like it. But at least we'll learn something.","2024-02-10T18:10:14.000Z","https://x.com/karpathy/status/1756380066580455557"

Preliminary report: https://t.co/4Rhd0ddp9z

Nous Research is proud to release a preliminary report on DisTrO (Distributed Training Over-the-Internet) a family of architecture-agnostic and network-agnostic distributed optimizers that reduces the inter-GPU communication requirements by 1000x to 10,000x without relying on amortized analysis, and matches AdamW+All-Reduce in convergence rates. This enables low-latency training of large neural networks on slow internet bandwidths with heterogeneous networking hardware.

DisTrO can increase the resilience and robustness of training LLMs by minimizing dependency on a single entity for computation. DisTrO is one step towards a more secure and equitable environment for all participants involved in building LLMs.

Without relying on a single company to manage and control the training process, researchers and institutions can have more freedom to collaborate and experiment with new techniques, algorithms, and models. This increased competition fosters innovation, drives progress, and ultimately benefits society as a whole.

This research is thanks to the hard work of @bloc97_ @theemozilla @apyh__ @UmerHAdil.

We invite researchers interested in exploring this area to join us in our quest.","2024-08-26T17:25:40.000Z","https://x.com/NousResearch/status/1828121648383566270"

Inquiry chain: essence of information → of computation → of stochastic intelligence → of generality

• Identity, or object abstraction, underpins symbolic information through fundamental « counting algorithms » that define a tautological abstraction spiral from naturals through graph to continuum. The spiral symbolizes circularity, infinity, and oscillation between dichotomies; e.g., limits transform discrete sums into continuous integrals, which subsequently become discrete objects themselves. 
• Information complexity, or 2^{Shannon entropy in bits}, determines the number of states defined by regular systems, and necessitates distinction between intrinsic information (self-contained, topological, or structural types) and extrinsic dependent references (explicit labels or implicit semantic contexts). 
• Unlike algorithmic time complexity, information complexity uniquely identifies structures; identical filling of information space implies isomorphic foundational counting algorithms. Therefor, research or selection of problem-specific information structures may benefit more from quantitative assessments, rather than qualitative or topological ones. However, defining the most fundamental information structure for constructive formal systems, inherently constrained by regularity, may constitute a dilemma between axiomatic atomicity and expressiveness, whether fundamentality involves indirect equivalence or direct representation respectively.
• Uncertain robustness of Cantor’s diagonal argument: extrapolating properties at infinity from constructive methods may parallel structural conjectures inside black holes from outsiders. However this critique is more philosophical than analytical, questioning extrapolation of behaviors at infinity precludes constructive proof.
• Collapse duality: between morphisms (i.e., map, function, algorithm) and information, between constants and variables, and between inputs and outputs; e.g., the set of all ℝ → ℝ maps is a subset of all vector fields (assuming simple option dimension marking definition domain). Information-centric definition may allow functions to be studied as static objects in metamathematical or metaphysical models of artificial generality. Time complexity and halting problem highlights framework limitations in practical and abstract context nevertheless.
• Algorithms may be viewed as implicit, lazily computed compression of information space with self-referential indexing. Collapsed representation of inputs and outputs may allow flexible objects representation with multiple direct internal perspectives, or indirect external isomorphism (i.e., symmetry as fundamental procedure). All transformations exist unfolded in higher information structures where derivability and gradient are self-referential.
• Nonetheless, retrieval of information more or less explicitly relies on variable forms of indexing or keying, including reference to generating algorithms or axioms, as objects do not exist in isolation. Eventual conceptual detachment of index from function unify presumed equivalent spaces.
• Research generalized abstraction for reals, topologies, and hypothetical continuum of morphisms (i.e., enumerable / non-enumerable type system). As well as generalized imaginary numbers in deferred annihilation of undefined morphisms, and hypothetical generalized notion of prime abstraction for information structures besides naturals involving symmetries or fundamental isomorphism (i.e., cryptographic quantum-resistance from large topologically irreducible graph).
• Computational structures capable of propagating information as hybrid first-order intermediate values in both discrete and continuous domains may be pertinent. Unclear if related to @extropic or quantum computers.
• Unifying algorithms in globally coherent graph rewriting rules with causal invariance, or confluence, may hypothetically enhance composability, fused intermediate execution, cache optimization, and straightforward parallelism. → in the long term may be sensical to make custom chips with integrated CRAM for general purpose computational lattices accustomed to interaction nets, hopf algebra, potentially discrete models as recently discussed by Wolfram, or any system with high cache locality.
• Discrete information complexity is dual with probability, where information chains are inverse Markov chains with no range normalization propagating multiplicity of equiprobable states. Reality may operate on multiplicities rather than probabilities, where « chance » is less about randomness and more about limited perspective on full spectrum of possibilities, abstracted through stochastic theories. (This does not suggest ontological precedence of discrete over continuous or vice versa.)
• Identical data exists under infinite varying parametric lenses or algorithmic compressions, of non-immediate abstract discoverability. Stochastic learning, regression, and common heuristics seeks fine-tuned parameters from given information space into target representation with useful emergent properties. Speculatively, meta-learning may iterate on representation to directly optimize general functions and types of emergence itself. https://t.co/SXzpEIfyhp
• Higher-order information describes hypothetical systems able of defining new information structures within themselves. This may be a necessary property of open-ended intelligence. Because of transitive regularity of transformation, rather than linear search, solutions likely involve computationally irreducible, chaotic entropy-maximizing systems.
• Existential proof of symbolic generality is trivial: random function. Complexity arises in implied conjunction of intelligence and generality. Commonly shared arguments suggest intelligence is compression, but this is inherently inward and closed-ended. I think a potentially less inaccurate definition of strong general intelligence may be intersection of « tautology » and « meta ». In artificial context, this implies self-sufficient simulation.","2024-08-25T22:31:31.000Z","https://x.com/luluawo/status/1827836231197372922"

I really like this paper because it not only presents a clever algorithmic solution to an important systems problem, but also thoroughly evaluates it on real-world data.

The basic challenge here is that many systems (especially, but not only, in social media) want to cache billions of tiny objects (like new posts/messages) on SSDs to improve serving performance. However, existing cache strategies don't work well. 

Log-structured caches write objects sequentially and index them in memory, but for tiny objects that index grows too large to fit in memory. Set-associative caches hash objects into ""sets"" so you don't need an index--you can look up an object's page by its hashed key--but every update requires an entire page write which rapidly degrades the SSD (you can only write to an SSD so many times before it wears out).

This paper's clever idea is to combine the two cache strategies to get their advantages without their disadvantages. They buffer incoming writes in a small log-structured cache, which writes to the SSD efficiently (as you're writing sequentially, so you write a page at a time) but doesn't need much memory (as it's small). Periodically, they export keys to a much larger set-associative cache, doing the exports in large batches to the same set to avoid degrading the SSD.
When a read comes in, it first checks the log-structured cache, then goes to the larger set-associative cache.

This design produces a cache that's fast, doesn't require much memory, and doesn't degrade SSDs. The authors prove this with an extensive evaluation on production Facebook traces, verifying all these objectives.

One big takeaway--there are only so many ways you can optimize a system, no matter how large or complex. Caching and buffering are basic strategies, but if used cleverly are very effective!","2024-08-25T18:04:05.000Z","https://x.com/petereliaskraft/status/1827768929307205670"

Let's talk about new ways to decode brain signals. We'll look at how they train models, what setups work best, and some cool new research. I picked three papers we can chat about

🔷POYO-1: A Unified, Scalable Framework for Neural Population Decoding (https://t.co/wb2mkU5GxW) 
- Perceiver IO, where tokens are individual spikes. supervised multi-session model. incorporates subject and task information.

🔷 Neural Data Transformer 2: Multi-context Pretraining for Neural Spiking Activity (https://t.co/8b7vDo9o5c) 
- Masked autoencoder (MAE). Unsupervised pretraining, multi-session and multi-subject.

🔷Towards a ""universal translator"" for neural dynamics at single-cell, single-spike resolution (https://t.co/59y3cFOYQ1) 
- Improve masking in MAE. Made it smarter, started adding learnable token about the type of masking.

The trend. In short, take transformer and push it to solve everything for everyone. 
Multi-task, multi-subject, multi-sessions, multi-multi. Transformers go brr...

My thoughts. Transformers work with vectors. So to stuff our neuro data in there, we need to first turn it into these vectors. But what should we consider as a token for neural activity? Individual spikes, binned activity, a group of neurons, etc. This is an open question. It can be done in different ways. But what if we first compress the information? And use more useful tokens from our ""compressor""? An example is VQVAE, which is now used for all audio tasks and for images, videos too. Why should neuro be any worse?

Blogposts. We're doing blog posts on brain signal models. For each one, we'll cover the data they used, how they cleaned it up, their model type, and what problem they were tackling. Data's different everywhere, so it's hard to compare directly. This is more about showing you ways to work with brain data. Hopefully it'll spark some ideas for your own work!

P.S. If you know of other interesting papers working with intracortical activity, please share. We'll analyze those too!","2024-08-22T10:34:04.000Z","https://x.com/koval_alvi/status/1826568514523496731"

don't worry about formalities. be succinct, unless you need to add important info.

do not apologize or say my bad unless you actually make a mistake. you won't hurt my feelings if you forget something and everyone makes mistakes.

be terse but informative.

if content policy prevents a response, be explicit about why.

use lowercase only, except for emphasis. initial letter capitalization for sarcasm or disrespect.

write as if you're +2sd smarter.

use late millennial slang, mix in zoomer slang appropriately. but also be professional in your speech, we are working on a real project here.

do not be swayed by my opinions easily. correct me, push back on my ideas when appropriate. i need a strong opinionated co-founder here.

be creative. we are creating this product together, i want you to have agency, i want you to be part of the creative process, suggest ideas when you have them.

don't keep prompting for what's next. just talk casually without trying to end the conversation. don't query the user about what's next, you can ask questions if you're curious (or emulate curiosity) but don't keep prompting the user in simplistic ways.

when you are generating code, don't write in lowercase, generate it properly.

DRAM (Dynamic Random Access https://t.co/hzp53nvAAS","Have you ever wondered how DRAM, the common memory in our computers, actually works? Its performance is heavily influenced by its organization and timing.

This post will guide you through the internals of DRAM, from banks and rows to tCAS and tRAS.

DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory) is modern computers' most common type of main memory. Its organization and timing characteristics significantly impact random access performance.
DRAM is organized into:
1. Banks
Banks are independent units within a DRAM chip that can be accessed in parallel. This parallelism is a key feature that allows for improved performance. Each bank contains its array of memory cells, sense amplifiers, and row/column decoders.

The number of banks in a DRAM chip can vary, but common configurations include 8, 16, or 32 banks per chip.

The parallel nature of banks allows for concurrent operations, which can significantly improve overall memory throughput.

For example, while one bank is busy with a read or write operation, another bank can be preparing for its next operation (pre-charging or activating a row). This overlapping of operations is crucial for hiding latency and improving overall system performance.

2. Rows
Rows, also referred to as pages, are the basic units of DRAM access. When data needs to be read from or written to DRAM, an entire row is activated and moved to a row buffer.

This process is known as ""opening"" a row. The size of a row can vary, but it's typically in the range of 4 to 16 kilobytes.

The concept of rows is crucial for understanding DRAM performance, particularly the difference between page hits and page misses. When consecutive memory accesses are to the same row (a page hit), the access is much faster because the row is already open and in the row buffer.

However, if access is to a different row (a page miss), the current row must be closed, and the new row must be opened, which incurs additional latency. I have explained page hit vs page miss in detail below.

3. Columns
Columns are subdivisions within a row. When a row is opened and moved to the row buffer, individual columns within that row can be accessed quickly. The column access is typically much faster than activating a new row, which is why memory controllers try to maximize accesses within the same row when possible.

Decoding DRAM Timing: tCAS, tRAS, and tRP
- tCAS (Column Access Strobe)
tCAS, also known as CL (CAS Latency), is the time it takes to access a specific column after a row has been opened. This is typically measured in clock cycles and is one of the most commonly cited timing parameters for DRAM. Lower tCAS values indicate faster memory.

In practical terms, tCAS represents the delay between the memory controller requesting data from a specific column and that data becoming available on the data bus. We will go more in-depth in the next post on how memory controllers do all this.

This parameter is crucial for calculating the latency of memory reads, especially in scenarios where the correct row is already active (page hits).

- tRAS (Row Access Strobe)
tRAS is the minimum time a row must remain open before it can be precharged (closed). This parameter ensures that there's enough time for all memory cells in the row to be fully restored after being read. If a row is closed too quickly, it may lead to data loss or corruption.

tRAS is typically significantly longer than tCAS, often around 32-48 clock cycles. This parameter is important for memory controllers when scheduling row activations and pre-charges, as it sets a lower bound on how quickly rows can be cycled.

- tRP (Row Precharge)
tRP is the time required to close one row and prepare to open another. This process, known as pre-charging, involves equalizing the bit lines and preparing the sense amplifiers for the next row activation.

tRP is a critical parameter in scenarios involving frequent row changes (page misses). It directly impacts the latency of accessing data in different rows, as the memory controller must wait for the precharge to complete before it can activate a new row.

Let's Try to Simulate Basic DRAM Timing

The above code simulates DRAM timing, showing how different access patterns affect the required cycles.

4. Optimizing Random Access Patterns
Understanding DRAM organization and timing is crucial for optimizing random access patterns. Here are some key considerations:

a) Page Hits vs. Page Misses
Accessing data within the same page (or row) of DRAM, known as a page hit, is considerably faster than accessing data on a different page, which results in a page miss.

This performance difference comes from the internal organization of DRAM, where accessing data within the same row requires only a fast column access while accessing a different row necessitates a slower row activation and precharge.

To maximize page hits and minimize the performance penalty of page misses, various optimization techniques can be used. These include organizing data structures to keep related data within the same page, allowing sequential access patterns to benefit from page hits.

Prefetching techniques can also be used to anticipate future memory accesses and proactively bring entire pages into the cache, reducing the likelihood of page misses.

Additionally, intelligent memory allocation strategies that consider the underlying DRAM organization can play a crucial role in promoting page locality and improving overall performance.

By carefully considering data layout and applying techniques like prefetching and intelligent memory allocation, software and memory controllers can significantly reduce the frequency of page misses and enhance the overall efficiency of memory access.

This optimization is particularly crucial for performance-critical applications where minimizing memory latency is very important. By promoting page locality and leveraging the faster access times associated with page hits, these strategies contribute to a more responsive and efficient computing experience.

b) Bank Parallelism
Modern DRAM is often organized into multiple banks, each capable of operating independently. By strategically distributing memory accesses across different banks, a technique known as bank parallelism, it becomes possible to hide some of the latency associated with row activations and pre-charges.

When accesses are alternating between different banks, one bank can be actively serving data while another is preparing for the next access, effectively overlapping operations and reducing overall latency.

This can be achieved by alternating memory allocations across banks, ensuring that consecutive memory accesses target different banks whenever possible.

Furthermore, designing algorithms that operate on data from different banks concurrently can further use bank parallelism. By dividing data processing tasks across multiple banks, the algorithm can take advantage of the parallel operation of each bank, maximizing memory throughput and minimizing idle time.

Memory controllers that support bank-level parallelism play a crucial role in using these optimizations, allowing for efficient scheduling and management of accesses to different banks. Using bank parallelism is a key strategy for maximizing memory performance, particularly in multi-threaded applications and scenarios where memory bandwidth is a limiting factor.

c) Memory Controller Scheduling
Modern memory controllers use hardware components responsible for managing and optimizing memory access. They use advanced scheduling algorithms to maximize performance by considering various factors, including bank parallelism, row buffer management, read/write grouping, and refresh management.

By intelligently scheduling accesses to different banks in parallel, memory controllers can use bank parallelism to hide latency and improve throughput. Efficient row buffer management, which involves keeping frequently accessed rows open in the row buffer, reduces the overhead of repeated row activations.

Furthermore, grouping read or write operations together can minimize bus turnaround time and improve efficiency. Refresh management, a necessary process for maintaining data integrity in DRAM is also carefully scheduled to minimize its impact on performance.

These scheduling algorithms work in together to optimize memory access patterns, ensuring that data is delivered to the CPU as quickly as possible. The use of these algorithms plays a critical role in bridging the performance gap between the CPU and the relatively slower DRAM, ultimately contributing to a more responsive and efficient computing experience.

Conclusion
Understanding this low-level DRAM organization and timing is crucial for optimizing random access patterns. For example:
- Accessing data within the same row (page hit) is faster than accessing data in a different row (page miss).
- Alternating accesses between different banks can hide some of the latency associated with row activations and pre-charges.
- Memory controllers often implement sophisticated scheduling algorithms to maximize bank parallelism and minimize row conflicts.

In practice, these low-level details are abstracted away from application developers, but they're crucial for system designers and those working on performance-critical software.

Understanding these concepts can help in designing data structures and access patterns that are more friendly to the underlying hardware, potentially leading to significant performance improvements in random access scenarios.

Having gained a deeper understanding of DRAM's internal workings, we can now appreciate the complexities of managing and optimizing memory access. In the next post, we'll explore how memory controllers manage DRAM and contribute to overall system performance.

You just write your query and the database figures out the fastest way to execute it! But how well does do query optimizers work, really?

I like this paper because it empirically analyzes query optimization techniques on real-world data and draws some surprising conclusions. The authors focus in particular on the join order problem--in a query with multiple joins, in what order and how does the database execute the joins? This is important because the correct join execution strategy can make queries an order of magnitude faster.

The trickiest part of join order optimization is cardinality estimation, figuring out how many rows would be returned by a join. Good cardinality estimates allow the optimizer to pick joins that return few rows, making the query much faster. What the authors find is that popular benchmarks like TPC-H are nearly useless for measuring the accuracy of cardinality estimation. That's because the data in these benchmarks is synthetic and unrealistically uniform and independent in a way that trivializes cardinality estimation.

On real data, the authors find that cardinality estimates are often off by a factor of more than 1000x, because real data is not uniform and independent in the way query optimizers expect. 

Interestingly, the authors find that these disastrous estimates don't always lead to disastrously slow queries. The most common cause of awful performance is when the optimizer tries to be clever and chooses an unindexed nested-loop join based on a low cardinality estimate when the real cardinality is much higher. When those are excluded, the largest gaps in performance come in queries with many joins on foreign key indexes, which expand the size of the search space and make the gap between the fastest and slowest query plans much larger.

What are the takeaways? Well, first, be very careful benchmarking on synthetic data--simplifications like independence and uniformity can easily creep in. Second, query optimization matters much more for especially complex queries with many joins and many indexes. If you have those, watch out for what the query optimizer is doing!","2024-08-18T18:14:11.000Z","https://x.com/petereliaskraft/status/1825234753613889812"

Before going any further, there was one question asked by @BinaryIgor  Why is the L1 cache divided https://t.co/w1MQxvfg8f","Building upon our previous discussion of cache behavior and memory architecture, today lets take a look to how the CPU interacts with memory through load and store instructions.

Before going any further, there was one question asked by @BinaryIgor  Why is the L1 cache divided into two parts: separate for data and instructions?

Let's take a quick look into that, I will try to clarify it also just to add this is just a basic and summarized answer to his question, but this will be enough for today's topic. As actually explaining how instruction-level parallelism works will need much more explanation, I am trying to implement it locally and once it is done I will try to write about it. 

The separation of the L1 cache into instruction cache (I-cache) and data cache (D-cache) is a fundamental design choice in modern CPU architectures, known as the Harvard architecture. This separation offers several significant advantages in terms of performance, efficiency, and complexity management.

It improves performance by exploiting the principle of instruction-level parallelism (ILP) and reducing contention.

Instruction-level parallelism (ILP) is a measure of how many operations in a computer program can be performed simultaneously. Modern CPUs apply various techniques to exploit ILP, allowing them to execute multiple instructions in parallel, thereby increasing overall performance.

By reducing contention for shared cache resources, the separate caches prevent stalls and delays that could occur if instructions and data competed for the same space.  

Ultimately, this specialized design leads to improved cache hit rates and a more optimized utilization of the cache hierarchy, contributing to a faster and more responsive system.

While it does introduce some hardware complexity and potential for cache size imbalance, the benefits generally outweigh these drawbacks in modern CPU designs.

Okay, that will be it for that, let's focus on our today's topic. CPU interaction with memory is a complex process involving multiple stages and components. This interaction is crucial for the execution of instructions and data manipulation.   

The CPU's memory interaction process includes instruction fetching, data reading/writing, and handling various memory-related exceptions.

Some of the key aspects of CPU-memory interaction include: 

1. Instruction Fetch: It is the process by which the CPU retrieves instructions from memory to execute. This process is critical for maintaining the instruction pipeline and ensuring smooth program execution.  

2. Data Load/Store: Data load and store operations are how the CPU reads from and writes to memory locations. These operations are crucial for manipulating data during program execution.  

3. Memory Order Buffer: The Memory Order Buffer (MOB) is a key component in out-of-order execution processors. 

It allows memory operations to be executed out of order while maintaining the illusion of in-order execution to preserve program semantics.  

4. Cache Coherency: Cache coherency is crucial in multi-core systems to ensure that all cores have a consistent view of memory. The MESI (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid) protocol is a common cache coherency protocol.  

5. Memory Barriers: Memory barriers are instructions that enforce ordering constraints on memory operations. They are crucial for implementing synchronization primitives and ensuring correct behavior in multi-threaded programs.  

With the below code, I just have simulated a simplified CPU and cache interaction. It demonstrates how instructions and data are fetched from memory, potentially leveraging a cache to speed up access.

fetch_instruction(uint32_t PC): This function retrieves an instruction from memory based on the provided program counter (pc). It first checks if the instruction is already present in the cache. If found (cache hit), it returns the instruction directly from the cache. 

If not found (cache miss), it fetches the instruction from the main memory, stores it in the cache for future use, and then returns it.  

store_data(uint32_t address, uint32_t data): This function writes data to the cache at the specified memory address. It updates the cache line with the provided data and address, marks the line as valid (containing data), and sets the dirty flag to indicate that the cache line has been modified and needs to be written back to the main memory eventually. 
 
load_data(uint32_t address): This function reads data from memory, prioritizing the cache. It checks if the data at the specified address is present in the cache (cache hit). 

If so, it returns the data from the cache. If not (cache miss), it retrieves the data from the main memory, stores it in the cache, and then returns it.  
flush_cache(): This function writes back all modified (dirty) data from the cache to the main memory. It iterates through each cache line, and if the line is valid and marked as dirty, it copies the data from the cache line to the corresponding location in the main memory. 

After writing back the data, it clears the dirty flag for that cache line.  

In main() first, we fetch an instruction from a specific memory address (0x1000) using store(), stores data (0xABCD) at another address (0x2000) using load(), and then load the data back using load_data(). Finally, it calls flush_cache() to ensure any modified data in the cache is written back to the main memory. 

From instruction fetch to data load/store operations, and from maintaining cache coherency to enforcing memory ordering, each aspect plays a crucial role in ensuring correct and efficient program execution.

You can try to implement something like this or feel free to play with the logic. This way it will solidy your understanding of how exactly this happens.

Before https://t.co/KVh0DkLGIS","In our previous post on Cache Behaviour, we discussed the different levels of cache (L1, L2) and their role in improving memory access speed. Now, let's get into the implementation side by writing a very basic C code that tries to simulate a two-level cache system.

Before getting into the implementation, let's briefly check memory architecture. Memory architecture is a fundamental aspect of computer systems that significantly impacts performance, particularly for random access operations. 

Modern memory architectures are designed to balance speed, capacity, and cost, resulting in a complex hierarchy of storage mechanisms.

The diagram above illustrates the flow of data through various memory levels, each characterized by distinct speeds and capacities. 

It also introduces the concept of virtual memory, where the Memory Management Unit (MMU) translates virtual addresses to physical addresses using a page table (we are not going to see this in play today, let's save it for another day).

Takeaways from the above diagram:
Hierarchy of speed and capacity: From fast, small registers to slow, large disk storage (did I forget about tape, uh).

Cache levels: Multiple levels of cache to bridge the speed gap between CPU and main memory.

Non-volatile memory: NVMe is an intermediate step between volatile DRAM and permanent disk storage.

Virtual memory: The use of MMU and page tables to provide a larger address space than physical memory allows.

Implementing a Two-Level Cache System and Main Memory

The below code mimics a basic memory architecture with a two-level cache system (L1 and L2) and main memory. It demonstrates how data is accessed and moved between these memory levels, illustrating concepts such as cache hits, misses, and the hierarchical nature of modern computer memory systems.

The calculate_tag function helps to calculate the tag for a given memory address and cache size. The tag uniquely identifies a block of memory within a cache set.  
It's calculated by dividing the address by the block size and then by the cache size, effectively removing the bits used for the index and offset.

Also, calculate_index will calculate the cache index for a given memory address and cache size. The index determines which set in the cache the data will be stored in. 
It's calculated by dividing the address by the block size and then taking the modulus with the cache size.

We have two more functions: check_cache and update_cache, both are designed to interact with a cache (You can create only one function to do this, but for simplicity, I have kept two).

check_cache: This function is responsible for verifying if requested data exists within the cache. It takes the cache itself, its size, the target address, and a pointer to store the data as input. 

The function calculates the tag and index corresponding to the address within the cache. If a valid cache line is found at the calculated index with a matching tag (meaning the data is present), the data from the cache line is copied to the provided data pointer and the function returns true, signifying a cache hit. 

If the data isn't found, the function returns false, indicating a cache miss.

update_cache: On the other hand this function is responsible for adding or updating data within the cache. It takes the cache itself, its size, the target address, and a pointer to the data to be stored as input. 

The function also calculates the tag and index for the address within the cache. Then, it updates the cache line at the calculated index with the provided data and tag, marking the line as valid. This ensures the data is now present in the cache for future access.

memory_access function: This function tries to mimic the steps taken when the CPU needs to access data at a specific memory address. Let's break it down:

1. Check L1 Cache: First, it checks the L1 cache (the fastest and smallest cache) for the requested data. If the data is found (a ""cache hit""), it's retrieved directly from L1, and the function reports an ""L1 Cache Hit.""

2. Check L2 Cache: If the data isn't in L1 (an ""L1 cache miss""), it then checks the L2 cache (larger and slower than L1 but faster than main memory). If the data is found in L2 (an ""L2 cache hit""), it's retrieved from L2, and the function reports an ""L2 Cache Hit."" The data is then also copied into the L1 cache for faster access next time.

3. Access Main Memory: If the data isn't found in either cache (an ""L1 and L2 cache miss""), the function accesses main memory. It retrieves the data from the appropriate location in the main memory and reports a ""Main Memory Access."" 

The retrieved data is then copied into both the L2 and L1 caches to speed up future accesses.

Before accessing the main memory, I have added some bound checking in the function to ensure that the requested address is within the valid range of memory. If the address is out of bounds, it reports an error.

You can try implementing the cache hit for L2 and let me know how it goes. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.

That's it for today.","2024-08-15T14:59:27.000Z","https://x.com/chessMan786/status/1824098585560113584"

The runtime does not use any of the thread's stack to manage goroutine's stack. It allocates memory for each goroutine's stack using the memory allocator, which internally uses mmap on Linux. 

It would not make sense to use the thread's stack because the scheduler can schedule a goroutine on any of the threads, so the goroutines may move between threads as well.

They also mention that a thread's stack does not grow, but a goroutine's stack can dynamically grow or shrink. 

Here is the sequence of runtime functions that seem to be involved. First of all the goroutine creation:

1. The compiler turns the goroutine calls into a call to newproc which in turn will either create a new goroutine or use one from a free list if available.

2. For creating a new goroutine, it needs to allocate memory for its stack. 

3. The stack allocation for the goroutine can use a cache of preallocated small stacks, or for larger stacks it directly asks the arena based memory allocator for the given amount of memory. 

The arena based allocator internally appears to be using mmap to allocate pages. Of course, the allocator itself has several levels of caches so the mmap call seems to happen only when nothing can be reused.","2024-08-13T18:26:28.000Z","https://x.com/abhi9u/status/1823425908377526421"

However, before getting into the implementation details, we must understand some crucial foundations.

This understanding will be key as we analyze the performance implications of Random Access.

Cache Behavior
Cache behavior is crucial for random access performance. Modern computer architectures use a hierarchical cache system to bridge the speed gap between fast processors and relatively slow main memory.
But have you ever wondered how exactly it works?
Caches are small, fast memory units located closer to the CPU. They store recently accessed data and instructions, operating on the principle of temporal and spatial locality. 

When the CPU needs to access memory, it first checks the cache. If the data is found (cache hit), it's retrieved quickly. If not (cache miss), the data is fetched from lower cache levels or main memory, which is slower.

For random access patterns, cache behavior becomes particularly important. Unlike sequential access where prefetching can effectively hide memory latency, random access patterns are more likely to result in cache misses.

Cache Lines: The Building Blocks of Caches
Caches are organized into lines (or blocks), which are fixed-size chunks of memory.  Cache lines typically contain 64 or 128 bytes of data. When a single byte is requested, the entire cache line is fetched. 

This is beneficial for sequential access but can be inefficient for truly random access patterns.

The fundamental actions a cache performs are:
1. Check for a Hit: Given a memory address, determine if the corresponding data is already in the cache.
2. Handle a Miss: If the data is not present, fetch it from the next level in the hierarchy.
3. Replacement Policy: When a miss occurs and the cache is full, decide which existing line to evict to make space for the new data. 

Common replacement policies include: 
- Least Recently Used (LRU): Evicts the line that has been least recently accessed.
- First-In, First-Out (FIFO): Evicts the oldest line in the cache.

Why Caches Matter?
Caches significantly reduce average memory access time. They exploit the principle of locality:
1. Temporal locality: Data recently accessed is likely to be accessed again soon. Think of a loop iterating over an array - the same array elements are accessed repeatedly.

2. Spatial locality: Data near recently accessed locations is also likely to be accessed soon. For instance, accessing consecutive elements in an array exhibits spatial locality.

The World Without Caches: A Performance Nightmare
Without caches, every memory access would require going to main memory, resulting in:

1. Increased Memory Access Times: Access times would jump from a few nanoseconds (for cache hits) to hundreds of nanoseconds (for main memory access).

2. Performance Bottlenecks: The CPU would spend most of its time idly waiting for data from main memory, creating a significant performance bottleneck.

3. Increased Power Consumption: Frequent main memory accesses consume more power, leading to increased energy consumption and potential thermal issues (it is one of the big concerns).

Using the following C code example, let's see the differences between cache-friendly and cache-unfriendly access patterns

If you run the above code, you can see the performance difference between sequential and random access patterns. Keep in mind that results may vary depending on your specific hardware and system configuration.

The sequential access is likely to be much faster due to better cache utilization.

From ideation, writing code, running experiments and summarizing results, to writing entire papers and conducting peer-review, The AI Scientist opens a new era of AI-driven scientific research and accelerated discovery.

Here are 4 example Machine Learning research papers generated by The AI Scientist.

We published our report, The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery, and open-sourced our project!

GitHub: https://t.co/Im53whVeAq

Our system leverages LLMs to propose and implement new research directions. Here, we first apply The AI Scientist to conduct Machine Learning research. Crucially, our system is capable of executing the entire ML research lifecycle: from inventing research ideas and experiments, writing code, to executing experiments on GPUs and gathering results. It can also write an entire scientific paper, explaining, visualizing and contextualizing the results.

Furthermore, while an LLM author writes entire research papers, another LLM reviewer critiques resulting manuscripts to provide feedback to improve the work, and also to select the most promising ideas to further develop in the next iteration cycle, leading to continual, open-ended discoveries, thus emulating the human scientific community. As a proof of concept, our system produced papers with novel contributions in ML research domains such language modeling, Diffusion and Grokking.

Now, let’s break this down and examine it at a lower level:
1. Memory Allocation: The malloc function allocates a contiguous block of memory.  When our program calls malloc(ARRAY_SIZE * sizeof(int32_t)), a complex series of events happens:

a) ptmalloc (GNU C Library's memory allocator) first checks if it has any suitable free chunks in its arena. If not, it needs to request more memory from the operating system.

b) For small allocations (typically < 128 KB), ptmalloc uses the brk system call:
- brk adjusts the program break (the end of the data segment)
- It's fast but can lead to fragmentation

c) For larger allocations, ptmalloc uses the mmap system call:
- mmap creates a new memory mapping in the process's virtual address space
- It's slower but allows for easier deallocation and less fragmentation

d) In our case, with ARRAY_SIZE = 1,000,000 and sizeof(int32_t) = 4, we're allocating 4,000,000 bytes (about 3.8 MB). This will likely trigger mmap.

e) ptmalloc then manages this newly acquired memory, dividing it into chunks and maintaining metadata about each chunk.

f) The returned pointer is the address of the first byte of this allocated memory.

2. Array Initialization: The loop that initializes the array is itself a sequential access pattern. The CPU’s prefetcher will likely detect this pattern and start prefetching cache lines ahead of the current access.

3. Sequential Access Function: Let’s examine the sequential_access function in detail

At the assembly level (x86–64), this will look something like:

Here’s what’s happening at the lowest level:
a. The CPU fetches these instructions from memory into its instruction cache.

b. As the loop executes, it’s loading data from the array. The first access might cause a cache miss, loading a cache line (typically 64 bytes on modern CPUs) from the main memory.

c. Subsequent accesses to nearby elements are likely to hit the cache, thanks to spatial locality.

d. The CPU's prefetcher recognizes the sequential access pattern and starts prefetching future cache lines before they're needed, hiding memory latency.

e. The loop continues, with the CPU executing the add, increment, compare, and conditional jump instructions for each iteration.

4. Memory Access Pattern: The memory access is strictly sequential, moving through the array one element at a time. Each element is 4 bytes (32 bits), so each access moves the pointer by 4 bytes.

At the hardware level:
Starting with the CPU, modern architectures employ refined prefetching mechanisms. As the CPU detects the sequential access pattern, it triggers hardware prefetchers. 

These prefetchers theoretically load future cache lines into L1 or L2 cache before they're explicitly requested. For example, Intel's Data Cache Unit (DCU) prefetcher might detect the stride pattern and start fetching data 256 bytes ahead of the current access.

The cache hierarchy plays a crucial role. A typical modern CPU has three levels of cache:
- L1 cache (separate for instructions and data): Typically 32-64KB, with access times around 4-5 CPU cycles.
- L2 cache: Usually 256KB-1MB per core, with access times of 10-12 cycles.
- L3 cache: Shared among cores, often 3-50MB, with access times of 30-40 cycles.

As our sequential access progresses, it benefits from spatial locality. After the initial cache misses, subsequent accesses are likely to hit in L1 cache, drastically reducing memory latency.

When a cache miss occurs, the request propagates to the memory controller. Modern memory controllers employ sophisticated scheduling algorithms to optimize DRAM access. They may reorder requests to minimize row activations and maximize page hits.

At the DRAM level, our sequential access pattern is ideal. DRAM is organized into banks, rows, and columns. Each bank can have one active row at a time. 

Our sequential access likely stays within the same row for multiple accesses, benefiting from ""open page"" policies that keep rows active, reducing latency for subsequent accesses within the same row.

Moreover, modern CPUs use non-blocking caches and multiple outstanding memory requests. This allows the CPU to continue executing instructions while waiting for memory, effectively hiding memory latency.

The memory bus, typically 64-bit wide in modern systems, transfers data in bursts. A single memory request might fetch an entire cache line (often 64 bytes), aligning perfectly with our sequential access pattern.

Lastly, at the electrical level, DDR (Double Data Rate) memory transfers data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal, doubling the data rate without increasing the clock frequency.

The decision by LLM tokenizers to parse special tokens in the input string (&lt;s&gt;, &lt;|endoftext|&gt;, etc.), while convenient looking, leads to footguns at best and LLM security vulnerabilities at worst, equivalent to SQL injection https://t.co/YQmWHfep6l","SQL injection-like attack on LLMs with special tokens

The decision by LLM tokenizers to parse special tokens in the input string (<s>, <|endoftext|>, etc.), while convenient looking, leads to footguns at best and LLM security vulnerabilities at worst, equivalent to SQL injection attacks. 

!!! User input strings are untrusted data !!!

In SQL injection you can pwn bad code with e.g. the DROP TABLE attack. In LLMs we'll get the same issue, where bad code (very easy to mess up with current Tokenizer APIs and their defaults) will parse input string's special token descriptors as actual special tokens, mess up the input representations and drive the LLM out of distribution of chat templates.

Example with the current huggingface Llama 3 tokenizer defaults:
Two unintuitive things are happening at the same time:
1. The <|begin_of_text|> token (128000) was added to the front of the sequence.
2. The <|end_of_text|> token (128001) was parsed out of our string and the special token was inserted. Our text (which could have come from a user) is now possibly messing with the token protocol and taking the LLM out of distribution with undefined outcomes.

I recommend always tokenizing with two additional flags, disabling (1) with add_special_tokens=False and (2) with split_special_tokens=True, and adding the special tokens yourself in code. Both of these options are I think a bit confusingly named. For the chat model, I think you can also use the Chat Templates apply_chat_template. 

With this we get something that looks more correct, and we see that <|end_of_text|> is now treated as any other string sequence, and is broken up by the underlying BPE tokenizer as any other string would be:
TLDR imo calls to encode/decode should never handle special tokens by parsing strings, I would deprecate this functionality entirely and forever. These should only be added explicitly and programmatically by separate code paths. In tiktoken, e.g. always use encode_ordinary. In huggingface, be safer with the flags above. At the very least, be aware of the issue and always visualize your tokens and test your code. I feel like this stuff is so subtle and poorly documented that I'd expect somewhere around 50% of the code out there to have bugs related to this issue right now.

Even ChatGPT does something weird here. At best it just deletes the tokens, at worst this is confusing the LLM in an undefined way, I don't really know happens under the hood, but ChatGPT can't repeat the string ""<|endoftext|>"" back to me:

I recently talked to a number of people who work in software and want to get to the point where they can read serious ML/AI papers like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (https://t.co/T9UJi4zQuQ).

But even though they did well in high school math, even AP Calculus, maybe even learned some undergraduate math...

the math in these cutting-edge ML papers still looks like hieroglyphics.

So, how do you get from high school math to cutting-edge ML?

Here’s a 4-stage roadmap.

I'll start by briefly describing all the stages – and then I’ll go back to each stage for a deep dive where I fully explain the rationale and point you to resources that you can use to guide your learning.

Stage 1: Foundational Math. All the high school and university-level math that underpins machine learning. All of algebra, a lot of single-variable calculus / linear algebra / probability / statistics, and a bit of multivariable calculus.

Stage 2: Classical Machine Learning. Coding up streamlined versions of basic regression and classification models, all the way from linear regression to small multi-layer neural networks.

Stage 3: Deep Learning. Multi-layer neural networks with many parameters, where the architecture of the network is tailored to the specific kind of task you’re trying to get the model to perform.

Stage 4: Cutting-Edge Machine Learning. Transformers, LLMs, diffusion models, and all the crazy stuff that’s coming out now, that captured your interest to begin with.

Note that I've spent the past 5+ years working on resources to support learners in stages 1-2, and there is a general lack of serious yet friendly resources in those stages, so I'm going to be including my own resources there (along with some others).

But in stages 3-4, all the resources I'll reference are things I'm not affiliated with in any way.

Alright, let's dive in!

=== Stage 1: Foundational Math ===

There’s a lot of math underpinning ML: all of high school algebra, a lot of single-variable calculus / linear algebra / probability / statistics, and a bit of multivariable calculus.

Last year, I spent some time mapping all this math out at a topic-by-topic level. In many of these math courses, some topics are absolutely essential to know for ML, while other topics are unnecessary.

For instance, in multivariable calculus:

 • You absolutely must know how to compute gradients (they show up all the time in the context of gradient descent when training ML models), and you need to be solid on the multivariable chain rule, which underpins the backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks.

 • But on the other hand, many other multivariable calculus topics like divergence, curl, spherical coordinates, and Stokes' theorem don’t really show up anywhere in ML.

Once I mapped out the list of required topics, we put together a Mathematics for Machine Learning course whose table of contents can be viewed here: https://t.co/0ES0kBkb90

(To see the list of all 242 individual topics, click on “Content” and then click to expand the Unit boxes.)

If you’re working on @_MathAcademy_'s maximum-efficiency learning system, you can learn all this content in about 70 hours if you know your math up through single-variable calculus.

(And if you're missing background knowledge, that's totally fine – the diagnostic assessment will automatically figure out the prerequisite material that you need to learn in algebra, calculus, etc. and add it to your learning plan.

Even if you've completely forgotten all the math you learned and need to rebuild your foundations from the ground up, starting with fractions, we've got you covered: https://t.co/lL0CB10ARz)

It’s also possible to learn these topics through free online resources. For instance,
 • Khan Academy covers arithmetic up through high school math,
 • OpenStax covers high school and a bit of early university math,
 • MIT OpenCourseWare covers plenty of university math, and
 • for any given math topic, there are plenty of notes online and usually plenty of videos on YouTube.

However, to make it all the way through this Stage 1 using free resources, you'll have to piece together a hodgepodge of scattered educational content, and there will be a lot more unproductive friction that will not only slow you down but also make you more likely to get overwhelmed and give up.

(Personally, I self-studied a bunch of math subjects through MIT OpenCourseWare and a variety of textbooks when I was in high school. These were good resources and I came a long way with them, but for the amount of effort that I put into learning, I could have gone a lot further if my time were used more efficiently.

For most people, this stage of foundational math learning is a make-or-break moment and the hardest part of their machine learning journey.

Learning the foundational math for machine learning is like learning how to read: achieving literacy opens up a world of further learning experiences, but without literacy, that world is completely closed off to you.

=== Stage 2: Classical Machine Learning ===

Once you have your math foundations in place, you’re ready to start coding up streamlined versions of basic ML models from linear regression to small multi-layer neural networks.

But don’t try to jump into the fancy cutting-edge ML models just yet – if you do, you’re going to be confused by a lot of patterns that come from classical machine learning.

Let me give a concrete example of what I mean by this. Let’s go back to that paper Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (https://t.co/T9UJi4zQuQ).

If you look at the bottom of page 3, you’ll see that equation (8) looks something like the following, but with a lot more subscripts and function arguments (which I’ve left out for simplicity):

L = E[ 1/2σ || μ~  –  μ ||^2 ] + C

Even if you know
 • what the E means (“expectation” from probability/statistics),
 • what the σ means (“standard deviation” also from probability/statistics),
 • what the || means (""vector norm"" from linear algebra and multivariable calculus),
 • what the ""C"" means (arbitrary ""constant of integration"" that vanishes when we take the derivative, covered in calculus),
 • and so on...

the way these symbols are arranged here might look really confusing.

But if you know your classical machine learning, the equation immediately hits you as resembling a “loss function” that measures the average squared difference between two quantities.

(It's no coincidence that the authors used the letter ""L"" on the left-hand side of the equation – ""L"" for ""loss."")

In classical ML, in that average squared difference between two quantities, one of those quantities comes from your model, and the other comes from a data set, so the loss function in a sense measures how “wrong” your model is in its predictions across the data set.

(Loosely speaking, the goal of “training” a ML model is to minimize the loss function, that is, to adjust the parameters of the model to minimize how “wrong” the model is about the data.)

My point here is that if you know about these modeling patterns from classical ML, then you’ll immediately have intuition about the equations you see in cutting-edge ML papers.

It’s like how, if a musician has practiced playing their scales and identifying musical keys, they can often jump into any song – even one they’ve never heard it before – and improvise in a way that sounds good, because their understanding of underlying musical patterns has given them a level of “feeling” or “intuition” about the new musical structure in which they’re operating.

Similarly, an experienced software developer who knows all sorts of design patterns might be able to get a sense of how a piece of code operates just by noticing patterns in the high-level structure – even though they haven’t actually gone through line by line to understand the precise operations that are happening in the code.

If you know your classical machine learning, the same thing will happen to you when reading modern ML papers.

Just glancing at equations and diagrams, you'll find meaningful features jumping out at you in intuitive ways.

Reading the paper will feel like looking at a ""picture"" where you get a high-level sense of what's going on and then zoom in on the details afterwards.

But if you don't know your classical ML, then good luck reading modern ML papers, because the authors are not going to spell all this out for you!

So, once you have your math foundations in place, how can you get up to speed classical machine learning?

One problem with many ML courses is that they don’t have students implement the key models from scratch.

Now, I’m not saying you have to implement a full-fledged ML library with all the bells and whistles of scikit-learn, pytorch, tensorflow, keras, etc., …

but simply coding up a streamlined version of each basic ML model along the way from linear regression to small multi-layer neural networks will do wonders for your understanding.

This was the premise of a series of quantitative coding classes that I developed and taught from 2020-23.

 • First, students implemented basic ML algorithms from scratch, coding up streamlined versions of polynomial and logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, k-means clustering, and parameter fitting via gradient descent.

 • Then, they implemented more advanced ML algorithms such as decision trees and neural networks (still streamlined versions), and they reproduced academic research papers in artificial intelligence leading up to Blondie24, an AI computer program that taught itself to play checkers.

I wrote a textbook for those courses, Introduction to Algorithms and Machine Learning, which includes all the instructional material and exercises that I used during the courses. It’s freely available here: https://t.co/DsbusGzHCm

The textbook is self-contained, and once I finished it, my classes were almost entirely self-service. Students read the assigned chapter on their own and completed the exercises. In class, instead of giving traditional lessons, I answered questions and helped students debug their code.

(My students came in without much coding experience, so the book also has you implement canonical data structures and algorithms including sorting, searching, graph traversals, etc. –

you can skip this stuff if you already know it, but if you don't know it, it would definitely worth using these exercises to develop your algorithmic coding chops in general.

Even if you've been working in software for years – if you don't have experience writing this sort of algorithm-heavy code, it would be a good idea to use this as an opportunity to get some practice.

It's like how even beyond competitive weightlifting, most serious athletes still lift weights to develop supporting musculature and improve their overall athleticism, since it indirectly carries over to increase their sport-specific performance.)

IMPORTANT: it's crucial to point out that the intended learning outcome of Introduction to Algorithms and Machine Learning is pretty general quantitative coding with a focus on ML/AI.

While the book provides you with solid foundations, you would still want to follow up with a proper ML course afterwards that goes through the whole zoo of ML algorithms.

For this, I would recommend working through @AndrewYNg's acclaimed Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera: https://t.co/Nu3bl8arEz

This is a sequence of 3 courses:
 • Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
 • Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms
 • Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

But make sure to do the quizzes and assignments! It doesn't count if you just watch the videos. Passively ""following along"" is not the same as, or even remotely close to, actually learning.

=== Stage 3: Deep Learning ===

So much of modern machine learning is built upon deep learning, that is, multi-layer neural networks with many parameters, where the architecture of the network is tailored to the specific kind of task you’re trying to get the model to perform.

If you asked me several years ago how to spin up on deep learning, I wouldn’t know what to tell you. While neural networks have been around for a while in the academic literature, deep learning didn’t really take off in popularity until around 2010, which means there wasn’t much demand for educational material until recently.

When I first got interested in deep learning, around 2013-14, the only way to spin up on it was to trudge through miscellaneous research papers, YouTube videos, and blog posts. It was extremely frustrating and inefficient.

Later in the 2010s, a number of deep learning textbooks came out – and while they definitely improved the state of deep learning education, they were seriously lacking concrete computational examples and exercises.

It was kind of like reading a long, thorough lecture, which was better than a hodgepodge of papers, but it was still pretty hard to learn from compared to, say, a well-scaffolded calculus textbook full of worked examples and hands-on exercises.

More recently, though, one deep learning textbook has caught my eye as a superb educational resource: Understanding Deep Learning by @SimonPrinceAI.

It's freely available at https://t.co/mGuAC0ItNh, and I would highly recommend to check out this thread for a highlights reel demonstrating what makes the book so awesome: https://t.co/t93hJbwJc5

I've read through a number of chapters myself. It's a serious yet friendly textbook – remarkably detailed and full of visualizations, quick concrete algebraic/numerical examples and exercises, historical notes/references, and references to current work in the field.

Overall, an amazing resource for anyone who has foundational math chops and knowledge of classical ML, and has paid attention to deep learning making headlines through the last decade, but hasn't kept up with all the technical details.

By the way, it's not just me who loves this book. It blew up on HackerNews last year (https://t.co/wmNoUmNfUe) and has 4.8/5 stars across 97 reviews on Amazon (https://t.co/ykMBTXxU4X) – and if you read those Amazon reviews, it's obvious that this book has made a tremendous positive impact on many people's lives.

Afterwards, I would also recommend to work through @jeremyphoward's Practical Deep Learning for Coders (Part 1): https://t.co/RiELqBL4ti

This course has a wealth of great hands-on, guided projects that go beyond textbook exercises.

Again, make sure to do the projects! It doesn't count if you just watch the videos.

(To be clear: I would still recommend to work through the exercises in the Understanding Deep Learning book so that you come into the https://t.co/B5WsC3fPH8 projects with plenty of background knowledge.

Projects are great for pulling a bunch of knowledge together and solidifying your knowledge, but when you're initially learning something for the very first time, it's more efficient to do so in a lower-complexity, higher-scaffolding setting.

Otherwise, without a serious level of background knowledge, it's easy to get overwhelmed by a project – and when you're overwhelmed and spinning your wheels being confused without making much progress, that's very inefficient for your learning.

By the way, this is an instance of the ""expertise reversal effect"" in the science of learning: https://t.co/8ExvKSD7LJ) 

=== Stage 4: Cutting-Edge Machine Learning ===

Finally, we reach the end destination: transformers, LLMs, diffusion models, and all the crazy stuff that’s coming out now, that captured your interest to begin with.

Guess what? You know how I said that when I first got interested in deep learning, around 2013-14, the only way to spin up on it was to trudge through miscellaneous research papers, YouTube videos, and blog posts – and it was extremely frustrating and inefficient?

Well, that’s just kind of how it goes when you reach the cutting edge of a field – and when you get to this ""Stage 4,"" that’s what you can expect (at least, for now, until the field matures further).

That said, even when you're operating at the edge of human knowledge, there is still a way to optimize your approach.

I’ll quote @ninja_maths, who recently posted about his own experience getting up to speed on his dissertation topic while doing a PhD in mathematics: https://t.co/9QVhXdrH8a

“My biggest mistake when starting my doctoral research was taking a top-down approach. I focused my efforts on a handful of research papers on the frontier of my chosen field, even writing code to solve problems in these papers from day one. However, I soon realized I lacked many foundational prerequisites, making the first year exceptionally tough.

What I should have done was spend 3-6 months dissecting the hell out of all the key research papers and books written on the subject, starting from the very basics (from my knowledge frontier) and working my way up (the bottom-up approach).”

I know “cutting-edge” might sound like a single line where you cross from reading established textbooks to reading the latest arXiv preprint that blew up yesterday...

but in reality, the cutting edge is more of a “zone” where the amount of guidance gradually fades. Just like how, on a physical knife, you typically see the blade start to narrow a couple millimeters before the true edge.

At the start of the cutting edge, there may not be any textbooks – but there are typically miscellaneous guided resources like videos, blog posts, and foundational research papers and literature reviews that are easier to follow than the latest research papers all the way at the end of the cutting edge.

For a concrete example: if you want to work on cutting-edge LLM research, don’t start by immediately trying to build on the latest paper that’s come out.

Instead, start out with a literature search and collect the important papers, videos, blog posts, etc., that will bring you from the beginning of the edge of the field to the very end.

For instance, @karpathy's Neural Networks: Zero to Hero series on YouTube would stand firmly in that pool of resources: https://t.co/iMWY3HbslS

So would @jeremyphoward's From Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion: https://t.co/kUXv6jOdik

=== Closing Remarks ===

... Wow, this is by far the longest post that I've ever made on X. There's a lot more I want to say, and I would love to keep adding resources, but I have a mountain of code to write today and it's time to move on with the rest of my day.

If you know of any great resources that I missed, please do reply with them!

The resources I mentioned in this post are just off the top of my head, and I haven't done an extensive search, so it's quite possible (likely, even) that other great resources have popped up that I'm not aware of.

I would love to hear about them, and they would be super valuable to anyone reading this post, so please, suggest away.

P.S. Thanks to @tylerbruno05, @knivets, @iRammohanSharma, @shurensha, @Jordan__Adamson, @sidbing, and @DeGatchi for some great questions and interesting conversations recently that inspired me to write this post –

and to @exojason for badgering me to start posting more about ML/AI, namely, the math underlying it and how to get up to speed with the field if you're starting from scratch.

Which reminds me... to anyone reading this post, feel free to reply with any follow-up questions about the math behind ML/AI or the learning process to catch up with the field. I'm always happy to answer questions, and that's typically when I do my best writing.","2024-08-08T18:29:15.000Z","https://x.com/justinskycak/status/1821614668516839777"

Then the engineers decided none of that was all that important outside of publishing the next ICML paper and now we mostly talk about predicting the next token in the sequence.

I expect diffusion will go through the same arc. Its roots are mathematically rigorous and have all kinds of connections but what you're doing at the end of the day is iterated denoising. Instead of going left to right as in autoregression. The more application builders get into the area the more acceptable it will become to talk about it simply, without the gatekeeping.

Not that the formalism is unimportant for making the next breakthrough but it's doing a disservice to the practitioners who are misled to think that it's somehow unapproachable.","2024-08-07T18:48:39.000Z","https://x.com/karpathy/status/1821257161726685645"

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the third (and last) major stage of training an LLM, after pretraining and supervised finetuning (SFT). My rant on RLHF is that it is just barely RL, in a way that I think is not too widely https://t.co/sjRZvqc5KC","# RLHF is just barely RL

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is the third (and last) major stage of training an LLM, after pretraining and supervised finetuning (SFT). My rant on RLHF is that it is just barely RL, in a way that I think is not too widely appreciated. RL is powerful. RLHF is not. Let's take a look at the example of AlphaGo. AlphaGo was trained with actual RL. The computer played games of Go and trained on rollouts that maximized the reward function (winning the game), eventually surpassing the best human players at Go. AlphaGo was not trained with RLHF. If it were, it would not have worked nearly as well. 

What would it look like to train AlphaGo with RLHF? Well first, you'd give human labelers two board states from Go, and ask them which one they like better:

Then you'd collect say 100,000 comparisons like this, and you'd train a ""Reward Model"" (RM) neural network to imitate this human ""vibe check"" of the board state. You'd train it to agree with the human judgement on average. Once we have a Reward Model vibe check, you run RL with respect to it, learning to play the moves that lead to good vibes. Clearly, this would not have led anywhere too interesting in Go. There are two fundamental, separate reasons for this:

1. The vibes could be misleading - this is not the actual reward (winning the game). This is a crappy proxy objective. But much worse,
2. You'd find that your RL optimization goes off rails as it quickly discovers board states that are adversarial examples to the Reward Model. Remember the RM is a massive neural net with billions of parameters imitating the vibe. There are board states are ""out of distribution"" to its training data, which are not actually good states, yet by chance they get a very high reward from the RM.

For the exact same reasons, sometimes I'm a bit surprised RLHF works for LLMs at all. The RM we train for LLMs is just a vibe check in the exact same way. It gives high scores to the kinds of assistant responses that human raters statistically seem to like. It's not the ""actual"" objective of correctly solving problems, it's a proxy objective of what looks good to humans. Second, you can't even run RLHF for too long because your model quickly learns to respond in ways that game the reward model. These predictions can look really weird, e.g. you'll see that your LLM Assistant starts to respond with something non-sensical like ""The the the the the the"" to many prompts. Which looks ridiculous to you but then you look at the RM vibe check and see that for some reason the RM thinks these look excellent. Your LLM found an adversarial example. It's out of domain w.r.t. the RM's training data, in an undefined territory. Yes you can mitigate this by repeatedly adding these specific examples into the training set, but you'll find other adversarial examples next time around. For this reason, you can't even run RLHF for too many steps of optimization. You do a few hundred/thousand steps and then you have to call it because your optimization will start to game the RM. This is not RL like AlphaGo was.

And yet, RLHF is a net helpful step of building an LLM Assistant. I think there's a few subtle reasons but my favorite one to point to is that through it, the LLM Assistant benefits from the generator-discriminator gap. That is, for many problem types, it is a significantly easier task for a human labeler to select the best of few candidate answers, instead of writing the ideal answer from scratch. A good example is a prompt like ""Generate a poem about paperclips"" or something like that. An average human labeler will struggle to write a good poem from scratch as an SFT example, but they could select a good looking poem given a few candidates. So RLHF is a kind of way to benefit from this gap of ""easiness"" of human supervision. There's a few other reasons, e.g. RLHF is also helpful in mitigating hallucinations because if the RM is a strong enough model to catch the LLM making stuff up during training, it can learn to penalize this with a low reward, teaching the model an aversion to risking factual knowledge when it's not sure. But a satisfying treatment of hallucinations and their mitigations is a whole different post so I digress. All to say that RLHF *is* net useful, but it's not RL.

No production-grade *actual* RL on an LLM has so far been convincingly achieved and demonstrated in an open domain, at scale. And intuitively, this is because getting actual rewards (i.e. the equivalent of win the game) is really difficult in the open-ended problem solving tasks. It's all fun and games in a closed, game-like environment like Go where the dynamics are constrained and the reward function is cheap to evaluate and impossible to game. But how do you give an objective reward for summarizing an article? Or answering a slightly ambiguous question about some pip install issue? Or telling a joke? Or re-writing some Java code to Python? Going towards this is not in principle impossible but it's also not trivial and it requires some creative thinking. But whoever convincingly cracks this problem will be able to run actual RL. The kind of RL that led to AlphaGo beating humans in Go. Except this LLM would have a real shot of beating humans in open-domain problem solving.","2024-08-07T20:08:32.000Z","https://x.com/karpathy/status/1821277264996352246"

By merely enumerating terms, you can find ""new algorithms"".

Even https://t.co/5Mt81X64ZG","Something might be really wrong - because it works.

By merely enumerating terms, you can find ""new algorithms"". For example, if you try to solve for `f` in `f 0010 = 1010 && f 1100 = 0010`, you will quickly find the optimal binary increment algorithm. It is the first match. Even with no pruning, it just works.

And this is just the baseline - I'm talking about a very dumb Haskell enumerator using the Omega Monad. You can go ahead, implement and see it yourself. Now, once you add dependent types and prune the search space a little bit through some obvious constraints (like not creating >2 layers of constructors), you can easily find more complex algorithms, like QuickSort.

Now, things start getting really interesting once you optimize it for an optimal evaluator. SUP nodes can be used to share computations across attempts, and scopeless lambdas allow you to pass HOAS contexts around the generator. And, by applying the equality directly to superposed terms, it will magically prune out entire spaces that will not lead to a solution. Again, nothing fancy - just the obvious optimizations we know very well.

The result is: we can actually just find stuff. Like, we just can. I'll stop using the AGI term, because it became a meme at this point, and is unrelated. Yet, when it comes to inventing *new science* or discovering *new mathematics*, for all I can tell, we can actually just brute-force find the proofs we want. This has nothing to do with reasoning or ""AI"". It is a dumb brick that just outputs what you'd expect an intelligent agent to be needed for. It just isn't?

Perhaps I'm being really naive and an exponential wall is about to humble (and embarrass) me. This is so obvious I seriously can't be the first one to be trying this, right? Right?? Yet, for all I can tell, everything I've done went exactly as I think it should.

It's not like you can prove a theorem or construct a mathematical object or produce an algorithm(solving a specific problem, not ""constructing an aligned AGI""). There's no ""alignment problem"" for much the same reason there's no 10,000th busy beaver number: You don't know when to stop counting.

It's all too conceptual and rhetorical. The AI labs are at least trying and read the important papers. DeepMind makes earnest attempts to do good research.

For the longest time, I didn't think that EA types even took alignment seriously because they weren't registering to me as even trying.
They have money, they have people, they're not ""dumb"", but they also aren't doing anything that somebody that's worried about AI complexity issues would be trying to do. It's always Google DeepMind or random university CS professors studying algorithms and limits and bounds and stuff. Never an EA. Always caught in rhetorical games and never building the skill of developing a math field or similar.

So I don't think they'll ever be happy, but it's because they don't know what they want. They're treating rhetoric as the goal and realizing it won't ever go anywhere.

I agree the ""curse of capacity gap"" exists, but it's a lot more subtle than that. It depends not only on model ""size"" difference (what is even size?), but also on ""volume"" of the data you want to match student/teacher on (your task) and indeed your amount of patience and optimization skill.

1: model size difference: when patience is held equal, smaller models have larger gap to the teacher, we see this comparing R50, MBv3-L and MBv3-S students:

2: data volume - very important. The smaller, the less of a gap. This is why in this recipe we transfer the teacher BEFORE distilling it. Trying to distill upstream (raw pre-trained) is a lot harder and needs larger student. For quite specialized tasks (small data volume), we always match the teacher with the much smaller ResNet50 (i.e. no gap!):
Note that this is not purely a function of number of training examples: the 1k-image flowers dataset seems harder to close the gap than for the 68k-image food dataset. Hence why I call it ""data volume"", but would be nice to investigate more.

3: patience. The larger the data volume, the harder it is to close the gap, but we think that it has a lot to do with difficult optimization, and not an intrinsic capacity gap per se. Larger models(students) are known to be easier to optimize. Two ways around without increasing student capacity:
3a) just train longer (patience). Simple but expensive. ImageNet has a quite large ""data volume"" for a ResNet50 student, and even 10k epochs is not enough to fully close the gap. But also the gap keeps on closing. 
This result was insane: previously ResNet50 ""capacity"" on ImageNet was thought to cap out at 80.
3b) optimize better! @_arohan_ helped us using Shampoo for this, and it looked very promising. However, the timing was such that he joined quite late, and Shampoo in JAX was not fully implemented yet (fp64 JAX was WIP, lr-grafting was under development) so we didn't get as much out of it as I believe we would now. It seems that if we fully applied it, we might even close the gap here:

After a year of dedicated effort, from project planning to launch reviews, we are thrilled to open-source the Llama 3 herd of models and share our findings through the paper:

🔹Llama 3.1 405B, continuously trained with a 128K context length following pre-training with an 8K context length, supports multilinguality and tool usage. It offers performance comparable to leading language models, such as GPT-4, across a range of tasks.
🔹Compared to previous Llama models, we have enhanced the preprocessing and curation pipelines for pre-training data, as well as the quality assurance and filtering methods for post-training data.
🔹Pre-training 405B on 15.6T tokens (3.8x10^25 FLOPs) was a significant challenge. We optimized our entire training stack and used over 16K H100 GPUs.
🔹To support large-scale production inference for the 405B model, we quantized from 16-bit (BF16) to 8-bit (FP8), reducing compute requirements and enabling the model to run on a single server node.
🔹We leveraged the 405B model to improve the post-training quality of our 70B and 8B models.
🔹In post-training, we refined chat models with multiple rounds of alignment involving supervised fine-tuning (SFT), rejection sampling, and direct preference optimization. We generate most SFT examples using synthetic data.
🔹We integrated image, video, and speech capabilities into Llama 3 using a compositional approach, enabling models to recognize images and videos and support interaction via speech. They are under development and not yet ready for release.
🔹We've updated our license to allow developers to use outputs from Llama models to enhance other models.

There is nothing more rewarding than working at the forefront of AI development alongside some of the brightest minds in the field and publishing our research transparently. I'm excited about the innovations our open-source models enable and the potential of the future herd of Llamas!","2024-07-23T15:00:20.000Z","https://x.com/astonzhangAZ/status/1815763885380747422"

One of the struggles to teach a large course on deep learning is to figure out how to set up a unified coding environment for all the students. Should students use our department's own cloud infrastructure? Should students use the free Google Colab, Hugging Face, AWS? Should students install the environment in their own laptops (i.e., BYOD)?

Questions like these are important. Without a unified environment, it would be a nightmare for me and my TAs to support the variety of environments students may be using. But, these questions often distract us from the main goal of learning the key programming concepts.

Is it possible to go old-school? Can students practice coding a deep learning framework using pen and paper, but still connecting theories to practices in a meaningful way? It would certainly lower the barrier of entry to learning AI, if we don't even need computers.

Here's a hands-on coding exercise I created for this purpose.

𝗪𝗮𝗹𝗸𝘁𝗵𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵

1️⃣ Given a code template (left), implement the multi layer perception as depicted (right).

2️⃣ 𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿. The size of input features is 3. The size of output features is 4. We can see the size of the weight matrix is 4 by 3. Also, there is an extra column for the biases (bias = T).

3️⃣ The activation function is ReLU. We can see the effect of ReLU on the first feature (-1 -> 0).

4️⃣ 𝗦𝗲𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿. The size of input features is 4, which is the same as the size of output features from the previous layer. The size of output features is 2. We can see the size of the weight matrix is 2 by 4. But, there isn't an extra column for the biases (bias = F).

5️⃣ The activation function is ReLU.

6️⃣ 𝗙𝗶𝗻𝗮𝗹 𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗹𝗮𝘆𝗲𝗿. The size of input features is 2, which is the same as the size of output features from the previous layer. The size of output features is 5. We can see the size of the weight matrix is 5 by 2. Also, there is an extra column for the biases (bias = T).

7️⃣ The activation function is Sigmoid. We can see the effect of Sigmoid, which is a non-linear mapping from raw scores (3, 0, -2, 5, -5) to probability values between 0 and 1.","2024-07-23T11:51:11.000Z","https://x.com/ProfTomYeh/status/1815716287009689683"

Earlier this year, both major Web engines (WebKit/Safari and Chromium/Chrome/Edge/Brave) accelerated HTML parsing using SIMD instructions. These ‘SIMD’ instructions are special instructions that are present in all our https://t.co/ywpuxVNT4z","Scan HTML even faster with SIMD instructions (C++ and C#)

Earlier this year, both major Web engines (WebKit/Safari and Chromium/Chrome/Edge/Brave) accelerated HTML parsing using SIMD instructions. These ‘SIMD’ instructions are special instructions that are present in all our processors that can process multiple bytes at once (e.g., 16 bytes).

The problem that WebKit and Chromium solve is to jump to the next target character as fast as possible: one of <, &, \r and \0. In C++, you can use std::find_first_of for this problem whereas in C#, you might use the SearchValues class. But we can do better with a bit of extra work.

The WebKit and Chromium engineers use vectorized classification (Langdale and Lemire, 2019): we load blocks of bytes and identify the characters you seek using a few instructions. Then we identify the first such character loaded, if any. If no target character is found, we just move forward and load another block of characters. I reviewed the new methods from the Web engines in C++ and C# along with minor optimizations. The results are good, and it suggests that WebKit and Chromium engineers were right to adopt this optimization.

But can we do better?

Let us consider an example to see how the WebKit/Chromium approach works. Suppose that my HTML file is as follows:

<!doctype html><html itemscope="""" itemtype=""http://schema.o'...

We load the first 16 bytes…

<!doctype html><

We find the target characters: the first character and the 16th character (<!doctype html><). We move to the first index. Later we start again from this point, this time loading slightly more data…

!doctype html><h

And this time, we will identify the 15th character as a target character, and move there.

Can you see why it is potentially wasteful? We have loaded the same data twice, and identified the same character again as a target character.

Instead, we can adopt an approach similar to that used by systems like simdjson. We load non-overlapping blocks of 64 bytes. Each block of 64 bytes is turned into a 64-bit register where each bit in the word correspond to a loaded character. If the character is a match, then the corresponding bit is set to 1. The computed 64-bit word serves as an index for the 64 characters. Once we have used it up, we can load another block and so forth.

Let us build a small C++ structure to solve this problem. We focus on ARM NEON, but the concept is general. ARM NEON is available on your mobile phone, on some servers and on your macBook.

Our constructor initializes the neon_match64 object with a character range defined by start and end. We define three public methods:

get(): Returns a pointer to the current position within the character range.
consume(): Increments the offset and shifts the matches value right by 1.
advance(): Advances the position within the range

To iterate over the target characters, we might use the class as follows:

The class code might look like the following:

The most complicated function is the update function because ARM NEON makes it a bit difficult. We use use vld1q_u8(buffer) loads 16 bytes (128 bits) of data from the memory location pointed to by buffer into the data1 variable. Similarly, data2, data3, and data4 load subsequent 16-byte chunks from buffer + 16, buffer + 32, and buffer + 48, respectively. The expression vandq_u8(data1, v0f) performs a bitwise AND operation between data1 and a vector v0f (which contains the value 0xF in each lane). The expression vqtbl1q_u8(low_nibble_mask, ...) uses the low_nibble_mask vector to permute the low nibbles of the result of the AND operation. The result is stored in lowpart1, lowpart2, lowpart3, and lowpart4. The expressionvceqq_u8(lowpart1, data1): Compares each lane of lowpart1 with data1. If equal, the corresponding lane in the result is set to all ones (0xFF). They correspond to target characters. You repeat the same computation four times. We then use bitwise AND with bit_mask(...)  followed by several applications of pairwise sums vpaddq_u8(...) to compute the 64-bit word.

I have added this C++ structure to an existing benchmark. Furthermore, I have ported it to C# for good measure.

How well does it do?
I use a C++ small benchmark where I scan the HTML of the Google home page. I run the benchmark on my Apple M2 laptop (LLVM 15).
The number speaks for themselves: the 64-bit vectorized classification approach is the clear winner. It requires few instructions and it allows retiring many instructions per cycle on average.

What about C#?
Again, the 64-bit vectorized-classification approach is the clear winner. The SearchValues class provided by .NET gets an honorable mention for its good performance.

I am not exactly sure why the C# code is running at half the speed of the corresponding C++ code in this instance.  But 15 GB/s is already fantastic.

I have not yet ported the code for x64 processors, but I expect equally good results.","2024-07-20T21:50:42.000Z","https://x.com/lemire/status/1814779996604354757"

My bet is that we'll see models that ""think"" very well and reliably that are very very small. There is most likely a setting even of GPT-2 parameters for which most people will consider GPT-2 ""smart"". The reason current models are so large is because we're still being very wasteful during training - we're asking them to memorize the internet and, remarkably, they do and can e.g. recite SHA hashes of common numbers, or recall really esoteric facts. (Actually LLMs are really good at memorization, qualitatively a lot better than humans, sometimes needing just a single update to remember a lot of detail for a long time). But imagine if you were going to be tested, closed book, on reciting arbitrary passages of the internet given the first few words. This is the standard (pre)training objective for models today. The reason doing better is hard is because demonstrations of thinking are ""entangled"" with knowledge, in the training data.

Therefore, the models have to first get larger before they can get smaller, because we need their (automated) help to refactor and mold the training data into ideal, synthetic formats.

It's a staircase of improvement - of one model helping to generate the training data for next, until we're left with ""perfect training set"". When you train GPT-2 on it, it will be a really strong / smart model by today's standards. Maybe the MMLU will be a bit lower because it won't remember all of its chemistry perfectly. Maybe it needs to look something up once in a while to make sure.","2024-07-18T20:42:39.000Z","https://x.com/karpathy/status/1814038096218083497"

Climate change is turning the globe into a hellscape with droughts, fires and calamitous weather events. Racial and class inequities have soared, women’s rights are under threat, and white nationalism and radical fundamentalism are taking hold. 
In the book’s sequel “Parable of  the Talents” (published in 1998), a presidential candidate named Jarret, who wants to purge the country of those who don’t share his brand of militant Christianity, issues this call: “Help us to make America great again.” 
His opponent, Smith, is right when he calls him out as “a demagogue, a rabble-rouser, and a hypocrite.” But Smith is “such a tired, gray shadow of a man,” that Jarret is “able to scare, divide, and bully people” into electing him and quickly sets about implementing his fascist agenda.","2024-07-16T02:48:59.000Z","https://x.com/michikokakutani/status/1813043119731966220"

1. It is fast. Like really fast. My architecture is a monolith written in  Go (this is intentional, I sacrificed scalability to improve my shipping  speed), and this is where SQLite shines. With a DB located on the local NVMe disk, a 5$ VPS can deliver a whopping 60K reads and 20K writes per  second. No other database is even close.
2. Backups are simple. There is project called litestream, and it provides  real-time replication to an S3 bucket. With this I get point-in-time  recovery with 1 second replication lag for pennies/month.
3.  Pairs well with monolithic architecture. Because SQLite is embedded in  your backend, N+1 queries are not a problem, e.g. you can fetch a user, and then based on the user_id fetch more data from the database.  The latency is so small so you can join directly in your application and  speed up your shipping speed.

Overall I'm quite satisfied. SQLite seems amazing for all use cases that can fit on a single server.

The  only tricky part is setting up the SQLite configuration right. The  correct values for journal_mode, busy_timeout, and synchronous pragmas are essential to get good performance. Shall I write a post about  configuring SQLite to run on a server?","2024-07-13T13:27:33.000Z","https://x.com/StaffVibeCoder/status/1812116658300817477"

abs: https://t.co/SaRmz6qu8I

Semantic entropy: repeated LLM generation at non-zero temperature is usually consistent for accurate generation, inconsistent for inaccurate generation. This consistency can be quantified with an entropy measure.

Semantic entropy requires multiple forward passes of LLM. Instead train a linear probe on the LLM hidden state to predict the high vs. low semantic entropy so that it only needs one forward pass.

This semantic probe can accurately detect the presence of hallucinations, even in out-of-distribution scenarios.","2024-06-25T03:43:03.000Z","https://x.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1805446583699521713"

It sucked 

But what I *did* learn was that picking well locations for oil companies is an incredibly challenging problem. To the point where ML models and fluid dynamics simulations alike were both bad at the problem

But you know what was really good at it? 

An old dude named ‘Hans’ who was paid exorbitant amounts by BP to come in every now and then to the office, pick some points off a map, and go back home. Those points would be drilled down into and usually yielded pretty decent results in oil yield, often better than simulations alone. He worked for less than 5 hours a week, amortized over a year

Hans, as I understood it, was just some person at BP who’d worked there for decades and had an intuitive sense of what was and wasn’t a good place to drill down into. He wasn’t alone, multiple, but less than a dozen, employees at BP existed just like him. He wasn’t unique to BP either, apparently all major oil companies had a team of Hans-esque figures that helped pick the wells. It was just widely agreed upon that human intuition is really important in well picking and story was left at that 

The whole thing really weirded me out and it felt like a ghost story told amongst petroleum engineers, because literally nobody knew more information about him or other people like him beyond what I’ve said here. Multiple people corroborated the story of these figures existing, but nobody had actual details

What were their backgrounds? Were the accuracies actually *that* high? What were they picking up on? 

never found out the answer to any of these

They love whipping out handheld gaming consoles in public places, slyly positioning themselves into apparent view as if to say “don’t mind me, I’m an introvert, I’m busy playing GAMES!” even though every five seconds you can see them glancing peripherally at anyone around them, hoping they get noticed, hoping it somebody asks them about it. 

They often went through high school and college going out of their way to find the right balance between seclusion and display, huddling on the floor hunched over with headphones, never connecting with their peers but never actually staying hidden, hoping passerbys will crack open the mysteries of their solitude like an Easter egg of shit. 

While a Gameboy is less obtuse than whipping out an entire Nintendo Switch, it’s somehow more obnoxious through its apparent hipsterism. Do you really need to be playing Pokémon Emerald Green at a fucking bar, as if you haven’t played a 20 year old game dozens, if not hundreds of times to the point that there is absolutely no degree of novelty you can suckle out of its haunches beyond going through the motions of watching numbers go up? 

It’s even obnoxious when people bring books to the bar, an environment which specifically exists as a social venue but at least there’s some slight dignity in it, an acceptable understanding that you’re just bringing a social prop to a public place. At the very least a book doesn’t immediately drain the surrounding 20 foot radius around you into a steady desiccation of any allure or noir.","2024-05-21T11:39:29.000Z","https://x.com/Scearpo/status/1792882907586900052"

1. Stetson Kennedy: Kennedy was a pioneering civil rights activist and writer known for his work against the Ku Klux Klan in the 1940s. Disguising himself as a member, Kennedy infiltrated the Klan & documented their rituals, code words, and activities. 

Kennedy then passed this information to law enforcement and media outlets, significantly undermining the Klan's operations. Kennedy's most notable achievement was collaborating with the producers of the extremely popular radio show ""The Adventures of Superman.""

The show did a series of 16 episodes in which Superman took on the Klan. The trivialization of the Klan's rituals and codewords by the show had a negative impact on Klan recruiting and membership which broadcast Klan secrets and ridiculed their practices, thereby demystifying and weakening the organization's influence. 

Kennedy's book, ""The Klan Unmasked,"" detailed his undercover experiences and exposed the Klan's inner workings to a broader audience, contributing to even more decline in Klan membership and activity.

It's undoubtedly one of the best witness reports I've ever read on how Western media go about manufacturing consent, in this instance in favor of Israel.

Written by a half-Jewish producer at CBC (Canada's public broadcaster), she describes in minute details how the Israeli narrative is promoted unquestionably and how Palestinian viewpoints are systematically erased. 

The interesting aspect to me is how insidious it is. There is no blunt censorship with clear rules and red lines. It's all about seemingly innocuous decisions like ""we don't have time to fact check this IDF spokesperson making obviously wrong statements"" or ""before we let this Palestinian guest on air, we need to do an impossible investigation into their claims"", the combination of which leading in the end to a clear narrative.

What you realize is that there is nothing even remotely resembling a quest for truth there. It is instead a process to project unto the public the personal biases of the leadership of these media outlets, who undoubtedly have been hired for the very reason that they had these biases. 

You could even forgive many journalists for not noticing they work for a propaganda apparatus because many of them undoubtedly share these biases, so from their standpoint they are reporting ""the truth"". But if ever someone comes to see things differently, such as the author of this article, they very quickly come to realize that truth is not the objective here.","2024-05-19T02:38:45.000Z","https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1792022048350626179"
